  #  Literate world population (OurWorldInData based on OECD and UNESCO)
  
  The year for estimates corresponds to the estimated dates directly reported by the CIA Factbook. For those countries for which the year was reported by the source as NA, we have assigned 2011 (the most common year in the dataset). The countries where this imputation took place are: Andorra, Vatican, Liechtenstein, Norway, Austria, San Marino, Cook Islands, Niue, Solomon Islands, Gibraltar.
  The source also notes: "This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world."

  # Abortion rates (per 1000 women) - Sedgh et al. (2016)
  
  Estimated incidence of abortions at global, regional and sub-regional levels over the period 1990-2014. This is measured as the number of abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years old.
  
  The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.
  
  Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.

  Max Roser has calculated the number of people in extreme poverty (living with less than 1.25$ in 2005 International Dollar) based on the World Bank (Povcal) data. I have downloaded the poverty headcount for each year and multiplied it with the population in each region to arrive at the total number of people in poverty. Both data sets come from Povcal and were downloaded on 1 August 2015. Data is PPP-adjusted and expressed in 2005 International Dollars.

  # Absolute population change - OWID based on HYDE & UN
  
  Data is calculated by OurWorldinData as the net change in population from one year to the next e.g. figures for 1900 represent the net change in population between 1900 and 1901.
  
  These calculations are based on the 'OurWorldinData'-series derived from various sources. The data for the period before 1900 are taken from the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE). The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) collected the data by earlier publications. The data for the World Population between 1900 and 1940 is taken from the UN publication 'The World at Six Billion'. The annual data for the World Population between 1950 and 2015 is taken from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/
  
  Data from 2016 onwards is based on the above UN source's 'medium variant' projection to the year 2100.

  # Access to financial account or services (%) - World Bank (2014)
  
  This data series extends from 2005-2014, and has been created through the merging of two independent estimates of access to financial services.
  
  Data for 2011 and 2014 has been sourced from the World Bank's Global Findex (Global Financial Inclusion) Database [available at: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports], which provides several measures of financial access. The dataset presented here is 'Account at a financial institution (% age 15+)'. This dataset is predominantly sourced from household and census survey data. The World Bank defines this parameter as:
  
  "the percentage of respondents who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution; having a debit card in their own name; receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months (% age 15+).
  
  Earlier global estimates of global access to financial services are less certain. To present earlier estimates, we have relied on composite measures of financial access reported in the World Bank's publication 'Finance for All?: Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access' (2008). The sources from which the World Bank draws upon for this composite indicator are referenced below.
  
  The World Bank defines this composite indicator as measuring "the percentage of the adult population with access to an account with a financial intermediary. The indicator is constructed as follows: for any country with data on access from a household survey, the surveyed percentage is given. For other countries, the percentage is constructed as a function of the estimated number and average size of bank accounts as discussed in Honohan (2007). These numbers are subject to estimation error."
  
  It should also be noted that while the majority of data is reported for the year 2005, some are sourced from earlier (thus the measurement period should be considered to extend from 2000-2005).

  # Active tuberculosis - IHME (2017)
  
  This dataset presents the prevalence of active tuberculosis (TB) by country, region, and globally.
  
  TB is a preventable, curable, and treatable infectious disease that usually affects the lungs, and can cause death without proper treatment.
  
  A large share of the population has latent TB, which means they have been infected by TB bacteria but are not ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People with compromised immune systems, such as those living with HIV or malnutrition, have a high risk of falling ill with active TB.
  
  Figures were calculated by Our World in Data based on data provided by the Institute of Health Metrics Evaluations (IHME). For the prevalence of active TB, we calculated the difference between the prevalence of TB and latent TB.

  # Adult literacy proficiency - World Bank EdStats and STEP Skills Measurement Program
  
  To calculate the average score in adult literacy proficiency from the STEP surveys we have: 
  <ul>
  <li>Calculated the mean literacy score for each individual in the survey (over 10 plausible value scores)</li>
  <li>Taken the sum of the mean literacy scores over all individuals</li>
  <li>Divided the aggregate literacy score by the number of individuals</li>
  </ul>
  The STEP data for calculated average adult literacy (8 additional observations) is appended to the PIAAC scores from World Bank EdStats dataset. 
  8 STEP observations include: Armenia (2013); Bolivia (2012); Colombia (2012); Georgia (2013); Ghana (2013); Kenya (2013); Ukraine (2012); and Vietnam (2012)
  
  As the STEP methodology note outlines "The STEP literacy assessment has been developed specifically for use in the context of developing countries, and it includes sets of questions taken from PIAAC, the International Adult Literacy Survey, and the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey. This overlap allows countries participating in the STEP program to compare their literacy results with those of over 30 other countries."

  # Age of democracies at the end of 2015 (Boix, Miller, and Rosato, 2013, 2018)
  
  The age of democracies is calculated based on data published by Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2018) on political regimes from 1800 through to 2015. Here we rely on Version 3.0 of Boix, Miller, and Rosato's dataset which was published in March 2018. The original version of their data was published in 2012.
  
  Full citation: "Boix, C., Miller, M., & Rosato, S. (2013). A complete data set of political regimes, 1800–2007. Comparative Political Studies, 46(12), 1523–1554." Boix et al. determine the political regime of each country from 1800 through to 2015.
  
  They define a country as democratic if it meets the following conditions for both contestation and participation.
  
  "Contestation:
  1. The executive is directly or indirectly elected in popular elections and is responsible either directly to voters or to a legislature.
  2. The legislature (or the executive if elected directly) is chosen in free and fair elections. 
  Participation:
  3. A majority of adult men has the right to vote."
  
  The age of democracies through to 2015 can then be calculated as the number of years a country has been defined as democratic. For example, Canada has been defined as a democracy for 149 years because it was coded as a democracy from 1867 to 2015.
  
  Note: The oldest democracy (the US) is listed as having been 216 years old at the end of 2015 only because Boix, Miller, and Rosato's dataset only extends to 1800. It would be more correct to state that democracy in the US is at least 216 years old.

  Agricultural area per capita has been calcualted by OWID authors based on data from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
  
  This has been calculated by dividing FAO variable "Agricultural area" by "Total population - both sexes" to derive "Agricultural area per capita" in any given year.
  
  The FAO define "agricultural area" as the sum of arable land, permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures.

  Producer Support (%): The annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers, measured at the farm-gate level, arising from policy measures that support agriculture, regardless of their nature, objectives or impacts on farm production or income.
  
  Total Support (%): The annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures that support agriculture, net of associated budgetary receipts, regardless of their objectives and impacts on farm production and income, or consumption of farm products.
  
  General Support Services (%): The annual monetary value of gross transfers to general services provided to agricultural producers collectively (such as research, development, training, inspection, marketing and promotion), arising from policy measures that support agriculture regardless of their nature, objectives and impacts on farm production, income, or consumption.

  # Air pollution deaths breakdown by age - IHME
  
  Data relates to the number of deaths attributed to air pollution across age groups. This is measured based on attribution to all linked causes. 
  
  IHME have developed a Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) conceptual framework by which they have built a web of risk factors or causes which affect health outcomes. 
  
  Such risk-outcome pairs (e.g. air pollution and lung cancer) are formed based on evidence links using methods such as cohort studies, randomised trials, and case-control studies. Once a risk-outcome pair has been formed, how does IHME begin to quantify the disease burden or number of deaths attributed to each risk? The CRA can be used for two different types of assessment: attributable burden and avoidable burden. 'Attributable burden' represents the reduction in current disease burden (or that of a given year) if population exposure had shifted to another counterfactual/hypothetical exposure level; 'avoidable burden' represents the potential future avoided burden if population exposure was to shift to a counterfactual level of exposure. Since the number of deaths is based on current or historical data, the data presented here is that of attributable burden.

  # Alcohol consumption by type since 1890 (Alexander & Holmes, 2017)
  
  Breakdown of alcohol consumption by type (wine, beer and spirits) in select high-income countries where data is available. This is presented as each beverage's share of total pure alcohol consumption.
  
  The original paper presents these trends as 5-year averages (e.g. 1980–1984). In this data we allocate a single year to each 5-year average – the last year of the period (1984 in this case).

  # Annual CO2 emissions - (Global Carbon Project & CDIAC, 2019)
  
  Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.
  
  Our World in Data has also defined the following regions as: 
  – "Asia & Pacific (other)" is Asia and Oceania totals minus China and India
  – "Americas (other)" is North, Central, South America and the Caribbean minus the USA
  – "Europe (other)" is Western and Eastern Europe minus the EU-28.
  
  "Statistical differences" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as "statistical differences".
  
  Our World in Data have renamed the category "bunker fuels" as "International transport" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.
  
  Historical data for Australia in CDIAC from 1820 until 1860 reports negative CO2 emissions. In this dataset, pre-1860 data for Australia has been removed.
  
  Each country and region's share of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) has been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual national emissions data published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). This is calculated as each country's share of the sum of all country emissions plus international aviation and shipping ('bunkers') and 'statistical differences'.

  # Antibiotic use in livestock - European Commission & Van Boeckel et al.
  
  Data on antibiotic use in livestock was derived from multiple sources.
  
  Antibiotic use across Europe is typically well-reported by the European Commission, allowing for the use of time-series trends. Time-series data from 2010-2015 for European countries was therefore sourced from:  European Medicines Agency, European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption, 2017.
  ‘Sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in 30 European countries in 2015’. (EMA/184855/2017). Available at: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2017/10/WC500236750.pdf.
  
  Additional data for the United Kingdom in 2016 was sourced from: UK-VARSS 2016; UK – Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance
  and Sales Surveillance Report (2017). Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/655403/_1274590_VARSS_2016_report.PDF
  
  Global-level estimates by country for the year 2010 were published by: Van Boeckel, T. P., Brower, C., Gilbert, M., Grenfell, B. T., Levin, S. A., Robinson, T. P., ... & Laxminarayan, R. (2015). Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(18), 5649-5654. Available at: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5649.full.pdf
  Full data from Boeckel et al. (2015) is available by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP). Available at: https://resistancemap.cddep.org/AnimalUse.php
  
  Antibiotic use is normalised to the average consumption per kilogram of meat production. This correction for livestock population sizes and types is termed 'population-corrected unit' (PCU). Data is reported as the milligrams of total antibiotic ingredient per PCU (mg/PCU), which translates to mg per kilogram of meat production (mg/kg meat).

  # Antibiotic use in livestock 2030 - Boeckel et al. (2017)
  
  Boeker et al. (2017) project global antibiotic use under business-as-usual antibiotic concentrations and projected meat consumption.
  
  The authors also project a number of potential reduction scenarios:
  - a global limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production.
  - a limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production for OECD countries & China.
  - global per capita meat consumption of 40 grams per day (the equivalent of an average burger patty)
  - global per capita meat consumption of 165 grams per day (the projected EU average in 2030)
  
  Projected global antibiotic use for livestock are shown for each of these potential reduction scenarios.

  This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). 
  
  This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index (PIN) here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices. 
  
  Values for arable land use and the crop production index (PIN) is sourced from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

  # Attitudes to Vaccines - Wellcome Trust (2019)
  
  The Wellcome Global Monitor is the world’s largest study into how people around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges. It surveys over 140,000 people from more than 140 countries. 
  
  Survey respondents were asked:
  (1) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statements? 'Vaccines are important for children to have'.
  
  (2) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? 'Vaccines are safe.'
  
  (3) Do you strongly or somewhat agree, strongly or somewhat disagree or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? 'Vaccines are effective'.
  
  For each question we have calculated the "share of people who agree" to be the sum of those who "strongly agree" and "somewhat agree"; and the "share of people who disagree" to be the sum of those who "strongly disagree" and "somewhat disagree".

For all other countries, data refer to births to mothers where the mother's marital status at the time of birth was other than married. For Canada, births to mothers whose marital status is other than married as a proportion of births where the mother's marital status is recorded. In 2017, the mother's marital status was not recorded on 8% of births. For Mexico, births to mothers whose civil status is other than married as a proportion of births where the mother's civil status is recorded. In 2017, the mother's civil status was not recorded on 8% of births. For Israel, data refer to births to unmarried Jewish women as a proportion of all births to Jewish women, only.

  # Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) and World Bank (PovcalNet) (2015)
  
  The share of people of living in poverty and extreme poverty is taken from Bourguignon and Morrison (2002), and ‘the poverty lines were calibrated so that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly with estimates from other sources’. And in footnote they say ‘these definitions correspond to poverty lines equal to consumption per capita of $2 and $1 a day, expressed in 1985 PPP.’
  
  To this I added the share of people living living below the international poverty line which, since the revision in 2015, is $1.90 at 2011 purchasing-power parity (PPP). The revisions in the definition of the poverty line and the PPP adjustment make the poverty figures in levels not comparable to earlier data – to illustrate this I have plotted both series for the time from 1981 to 1992. The World Bank data was downloaded in October 2015.

  # CFC consumption - UNEP
  
  Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.

  # CO2 Footprint Breakdown Per Capita - Goodall (2011)
  
  The data sourced from Chris Goodall's book is representative of the composition of the average carbon footprint in the United Kingdom at the time of writing (reprinted in 2011). Significant variability between individual lifestyles in the UK, and across comparable high-income countries is to be expected. This breakdown does not include estimates of per capita contribution to national services, manufacturing and infrastructure; Goodall estimated this additional component to comprise approximately 35% of an individual's footprint.

  # CO2 concentrations - NOAA (2019)
  
  Annual mean CO₂ concentrations in the atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm).
  
  Long-term global average atmospheric concentrations of CO₂ have been combined using several sources, all available at the NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division.
  
  Very long-term data from ice cores – specifically the Dome C core – has been made available from the NOAA here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/17975. In this original dataset, some years had multiple measurements (taken at different points of the year). To normalize this to a single year, where several measurements were available, we took the average of these concentration values.

  Dome C data has been used until the year 1958. 
  
  Data from 1959 through 1979 have been obtained by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).

  # CO2 emissions embedded in trade - Global Carbon Project (2018)
  
  Net carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions embedded in trade is the net of CO₂ which is imported or exported via traded goods with an economy. A positive value here denotes a country or region is a net importer of CO₂ emissions; a negative value indicates a country is a net exporter.
  
  Data is sourced from the Global Carbon Budget (2018): https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/18/data.htm. This presents territorial emissions data in addition to consumption-based and emissions transfers. Consumption-based and emissions transfer estimates are produced by the updated paper by Peters et al. (2011).
  
  Data has been converted from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide by Our World in Data using a conversion factor of 3.664. Figures were also multiplied by -1 such that net exports are shown as a negative value; and net imports as a positive value.
  
  This data has also been calculated by Our World in Data as a share of territorial emissions. This was calculated by dividing emissions transfers (emissions embedded in trade) by a country or region's territorial emissions.

  # CO2 emissions factors of energy sources (IPCC, 2014)
  
  Lifecycle greenhouse gas emission factors for different fuel sources, as reported in the IPCC's latest 5th Assessment Report (AR5). These emissions factors include all greenhouse gases (normalised to carbon dioxide-equivalents) and stages of the supply chain, including direct combustion, infrastructure and supply chains, and albedo effect.
  
  All figures, with the exception of oil are sourced from the IPCC's AR5 Working Group III Annex: https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf
  
  Emissions factors are given for select electricity sources in gCO₂/kWh – which does not include crude oil. To derive a comparable emissions factor for oil, we have taken the emissions factor for coal in gCO₂/kWh and multiplied it by the ratio of coal-to-oil default emissions factors in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, available here: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_1_Ch1_Introduction.pdf
  
  So, the emissions factor for oil is derived as 833gCO₂eq/kWh * [73 300 / 98 300] = 611 gCO₂eq/kWh.

  Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'start year scenarios': scenarios are based on the annual emission reductions necessary to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C if emissions mitigation was to start in a given year. 
  
  For example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5C warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking then falling.

  # CO2 per year by region - CDIAC (2017)
  
  Emissions data have been converted from units of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2) using a conversion factor of 3.67. Regions denoted "other" are given as regional totals minus emissions from the EU-28, USA, China and India. Here, we have rephrased the general term "bunker (fuels)" as "international aviation and maritime transport" for clarity.
  
  CDIAC denote a "statistical difference" component which has been included in this data. This statistical difference represents the difference between estimated global CO2 emissions and the sum of national totals. Estimates of CO2 emissions show that the global total of emissions is not equal to the sum of emissions from all countries. This is introduced in several cases: emissions within international territories, which are included in global totals but not attributed to individual countries; inconsistent national reporting where global import and export data is imbalanced; and differing treatment of non-fuel uses of hydrocarbons.
  
  Full methodology on global, regional, national and statistical difference estimations can be found in Le Quere et al. (2016): Le Quéré, C., Andrew, R. M., Canadell, J. G., Sitch, S., Korsbakken, J. I., Peters, G. P., ... & Keeling, R. F. (2016). Global carbon budget 2016. Earth System Science Data, 8(2), 605. Available at: doi:10.5194/essd-8-605-2016.

  The coefficient variation (CV) measures the inequality of caloric intake across a given population. It represents a statistical measure of the data spread around the mean caloric intake. Higher CV values represent larger levels of dietary inequality.
  
  Where data is sufficiently available, the FAO estimate the CV based on household survey data. Where unavailable, it is calculated based on regression analysis from Gini coefficient, income and food price data.
  
  The CV of caloric intake is reported only for developing countries within the Food Security Indicators.

  # Cancer deaths grouped - OWID based on IHME
  
  Total annual number of deaths from cancers (termed 'Neoplasms' within the IHME, Global Burden of Disease Study). This measures cancer deaths across both sexes and all ages.
  
  Smaller categories of cancer types have been grouped by Our World in Data into a collective category 'Other cancers'. This grouping was set based on cancer types with global annual deaths in 2016 under 100,000. This includes testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, mesothelioma, thyroid, non-melanoma skin cancer, nasopharynx, malignant skin melanoma, uterine cancer, and multiple myeloma.

  # Carbon intensity (kgCO2/$) - Madisson, World Bank, CDIAC
  
  Carbon intensity was calculated by dividing total national CO2 emissions by gross domestic product (2011 int-$ PPP) for a given year. These figures are presented in kgCO2 per international-$ PPP.
  
  Annual CO2 emissions data was derived from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC): http://cdiac.ornl.gov/CO2_Emission/ (accessed on 20th April 2017). CDIAC generates estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel consumption and cement production at global and national levels, dating historically to 1751.
  
  GDP figures are presented in 2011 international-$ PPP based on backward extension of World Bank and Maddison datasets. The data presented here from 1990 onwards is from the World Bank. It is total global and national GDP in 2011 international-$ as published here: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD (accessed on 20th April 2017). Data earlier than 1990 is backwards extended from the World Bank observation for 1990 based on the growth rates implied by Maddison data. The Maddison data is published here: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm

  # Carbon intensity over the long-run - OWID based on GCP & Maddison
  
  Carbon intensity was calculated by Our World in Data based on the combination of two sources. This was calculated by dividing total carbon dioxide figures published by the Global Carbon Project, and long-term GDP figures from the Maddison Project Database.
  
  CO₂ emissions sourced from Le Quéré et al. (2017). Global Carbon Project. Data has been converted from million tonnes of carbon to million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664. Available at: http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/17/data.htm.
  
  Real GDP data was sourced from the Maddison Project Database (version 2018). Measure of real GDP accounts for inflation, i.e. changes in the price level, and this measure is suitable for cross-country income comparisons.

  # Carbon tetrachloride consumption - UNEP
  
  Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.

  # Causes of death vs. media coverage (Shen et al. 2018)
  
  Shen et al. (2018) compared the leading causes of death in the United States as their share of total deaths relative to Google searches and media coverage in The New York Times (NYT) and The Guardian newspaper. For this analysis they selected the top 10 causes of death in the USA in addition to terrorism, homicide, and drug overdoses (which they assumed to also receive significant media attention).
  
  Data each causes' share of total deaths in the USA was assessed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database for public health, available at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/. This is available from 1999 to 2016. Combined, the 13 causes of death assessed in this analysis account for approximately 88% of all deaths in the USA.
  
  Data on Google searches was derived from Google Trends (available from 2004 to 2016). This was assessed on the number of searches for these terms and close synonyms.
  
  The New York Times and The Guardian media coverage was assessed from both newspapers' article databases. Here the authors searched the database for a list of all articles which contained the word anywhere (headline or body).
  
  All values are normalized to 100% so they represent their relative share of the top causes, rather than absolute 
  counts (e.g. ‘deaths’ represents each causes’ share of deaths within the 13 categories shown rather than total deaths). This allows for us to compare the relative representation of different sources.
  
  Full methodology, notes and open-access data on GitHub are available from the original source: https://owenshen24.github.io/charting-death/.

  # Causes of death vs. media coverage - Shen
  
  Data was compiled and published by Owen Shen, tallying comparisons between the share of deaths, google searches and media coverage across a range of causes of death.
  
  This includes the top 10 largest causes of mortality, as well as terrorism, overdoses, and homicides (the three additional causes of death which get significant media coverage). These are normalised to be given as deaths, Google searches and media coverage as a share of the total reported across these 13 causes (which does not mean the share of deaths or coverage of all causes of death).
  
  The values given represent their relative share, rather than absolute counts. This allows for comparison of the proportionality in representation across different sources.

  # Cereal production index - WDI (2017)
  
  Cereal production index was derived by OurWorldinData based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).
  
  The cereal production index measures annual cereal production as an index to production in 1961, the first year of the original dataset. This index was calculated by dividing cereal production values (which are measured in metric tonnes per year) in any given year by cereal production in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in production vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.
  The original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was "Cereal production (metric tons)", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as: "Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded."

  # Cereal yield index - (World Bank (2017) & OWID)
  
  Cereal yield index was derived by OurWorldinData based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).
  
  The cereal yield index measures annual cereal production as an index to average yields in 1961, the first year of the original dataset. This index was calculated by dividing cereal yield values (which are measured in kilograms per hectare) in any given year by cereal yields in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in yield vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.
  The original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was "Cereal yield (kg per hectare)", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as: "Cereal yield, measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested land, includes wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded. The FAO allocates production data to the calendar year in which the bulk of the harvest took place. Most of a crop harvested near the end of a year will be used in the following year."

  Please note that for some countries the Chartbook includes additional time series for economic inequality.
  
  The purpose of the Chartbook is to present consistent time-series for each country over time. Unfortunately there are important cases in which the comparability between countries is limited. The table below lists the definition of the Gini time series for each country and differences in definitions should be taken into account when making cross-country comparisons.
  
  The addition of series x behind the definition indicates that there are several Gini time-series available for this country in the Chartbook and they can be found at the country page there.

  The incidence of child labour in males and females aged 10-13 has been taken directly from the source; this is available for both rural and urban demographics individually.
  
  To calculate the incidence of child labour across both sexes combined, we have weighted gender-specific incidences based on the male:female ratio in the total population for this age bracket (these are based on reported gender ratios, which may incur rounding errors). The same weighting application of population in rural vs. urban areas has been carried out to provide a combined rural & urban figure of incidence.

  # Child Mortality Rates (Complete Gapminder, v10) (2017)
  
  Data is that of version 10 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019. This is the full child mortality rate dataset published by Gapminder.
  
  Gapminder's sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/
  
  It notes its data sources during three key periods of time:
  
  — 1800 to 1950: Gapminder v7  ( In some cases this is also used for years after 1950, see below.) This was compiled and documented by Mattias Lindgren from many sources, but mainly based on www.mortality.org and the series of books called International Historical Statistics  by Brian R Mitchell, which often have historic estimates of Infant mortality rate which were converted to Child mortality through regression. See detailed documentation of v7 below.
  — 1950 to 2016: UNIGME, is a data collaboration project between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population Division and the World Bank. They  released new estimates of child mortality for countries and a global estimate on October 17, 2017, which is available at www.childmortality.org. In this dataset almost all countries have estimates between 1970 and 2016, while roughly half the countries also reach back to 1950.
  — 1950 to 2100: UN WPP, World Population Prospects 2017  provides annual data for Child mortality rate for all countries in the interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx, accessed on September 2, 2017.
  
  Version 12 of the dataset extends back to the year 1800. Version 6 of Gapminder's fertility series includes data for a few countries further than 1800. We have included more historic data from Version 6 for Finland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. All data from 1800 onwards is from Version 12; data from pre-1800 is from Version 6.
  
  There are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950. To develop full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates. This series presents the full Gapminder dataset: both those from published estimates and estimates made by Gapminder with high uncertainty. This is provided so users have access to the full dataset.
  
  However, for our main long-term series on child mortality rates at Our World in Data we exclude the highly uncertain data points which are not backed up with published estimates within the literature. Users looking for a series with less uncertainty should refer to that instead.

  We also publish the full dataset from Gapminder for users looking for a complete series. However, we should highlight that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty. This dataset can be accessed here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-complete

  # Child deaths by life stage (OWID based on UN IGME)
  
  Data represents the total number of deaths of children (under 5 years old) by life stage. 
  
  This is split into three categories: 
  - the first 28 days of life; 
  - 29 days to 1 year; 
  - 1-4 years.
  
  This was calculated by Our World in Data based on data on neonatal, infant and under-5 deaths published by the World Bank (based on the UN IGME).
  
  - The first 28 days of life are equally to neonatal deaths;
  - 29 days to 1 year are calculated as infant minus neonatal deaths;
  - 1-4 years calculated as under-5s minus infant deaths.

  # Conflict and Terrorism deaths - OWID based on IHME & GTD
  
  Data for conflict and terrorism deaths has been differentiated by Our World in Data based on published figures by the IHME, Global Burden of Disease (GBD), and Global Terrorism Database (GTD).
  
  The IHME, GBD report combined deaths from 'Conflict and Terrorism'. To differentiate 'conflict' deaths, we have subtracted number of terrorism deaths published by the GTD from this combined metric of 'Conflict and Terrorism'. 
  
  We have also calculated both of these individual parameters in terms of the percentage of total deaths, by dividing by IHME figures of deaths for 'All causes'.
  
  Note that in some cases, estimates of homicide, conflict and terrorism can be challenging to differentiate, with different estimates from different sources and definitions. For terrorism, we have used data from the GTD; full data and definitions can be found at our entry: www.ourworldindata.org/terrorism

  # Conflict deaths – UCDP Georeferenced Event Data (2019)
  
  UCDP (GED) v19.1 provides estimates for direct conflict deaths (i.e. excluding indirect deaths from disease, malnutrition, exposure etc.) of both civilians and military personnel occurring in individual geo-referenced events. Taking the 'best' deaths estimates, we have aggregated these to country-year observations.
  
  UCDP documentation makes it clear that the dataset is intended to have global coverage since 1989, except for the case of Syria. As such, any country-year (as defined by the Gleditsch and Ward system of states) in which no events are recorded in the data were attributed zero deaths, except for Syria in this period.
  
  The World total figures are not an aggregation of the GED dataset (given the lack of coverage just mentioned). Instead it combines the three non-georeferenced datasets UCDP provides, covering three kinds of violence: One-sided violence, Non-state conflicts and State-based conflicts.
  
  Death rates are calculated using UN population figures.

  # Consumption shares in selected non-essential products - World Bank Global Consumption Database
  
  The Global Consumption Database is composed of individual country surveys to form a database on household consumption patterns in developing countries. The data has been standardized following a six-step process: 
  
  <ul>
  <li>Step 1: Annualizing consumption or expenditure data:
  In simple cases, this amounts to using a multiplying factor determined by the recall period (the period in which households are asked to recall their expenditure during that period). For example, food data collected for the last 7 days would be divided by 7, then multiplied by 365; monthly values by 12 etc. </li>
  <li> Step 2: Detecting and fixing outliers:
  Expenditure values were flagged to be outliers if they exceeded the average amount consumed in the third quartile plus 5 times the interquartile range (the difference between the first and third quartiles of the data). 
  Any flagged values need to be confirmed before imputations are made. If three or more non-food values are flagged as outliers for a household, it was assumed this indicates a rich household; hence the flags were removed. Households in the top two consumption quintiles were also assumed to spend unusually large shares of their income on education and jewellery. Outlier values that did not fit either of these criteria were replaced with the weighted mean of the non-extreme values for the consumption variable in question. </li>
  <li> Step 3: Mapping commodities to the ICP/COICOP classification:
  Commodities found in each survey dataset were mapped to a standard classification of products and services, and then aggregate standard products and services into sectors and categories. This used the International Comparison Program (ICP) classification which is equivalent to the International Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). </li>
  <li> Step 4: Extrapolation to 2010:
  Extrapolations were undertaken to convert all consumption and population data to a common reference year, 2010. For example, for the 2007 survey conducted in Guinea: final consumption expenditure per capita in LCU was 3,177,774 in 2010 and 1,547,012 in 2007 (the survey year). All survey values were therefore multiplied by 3,177,774/1,547,012=2.054137. 
  Consumption data were converted from local currencies to international dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP$). </li>
  <li> Step 5: Review and validation: 
  Data was compared with other sources, notably the respective survey reports, and the World Bank’s poverty dataset, Povcalnet. </li>
  <li> Step 6: Production of summary tables and metadata:
  The World Bank generated of a standard set of tables for each country showing consumption and demographic patterns across consumption segments. </li>
  </ul>
  
  For more information on the Global Consumption Database methodology see: http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Standardization of Data’ tab.
  
  As the World Bank’s Global Consumption Database draws on a variety of country surveys which differ in design, methodology, and timing, there are limits to the extent to which surveys can be standardized. Therefore, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. For more information see http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Note on comparability’ tab.
  
  All figures reported are based on national totals. The World Bank notes “each survey is composed of ordinary households only; “institutional households” (prisons, military barracks, hospitals, convents, and others) are not covered by household surveys. Homeless and nomadic populations and visitors present in a country during a survey are also excluded from the sample.” 
  
  The surveys used in the database were conducted between 2000 and 2010. For more information see http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Sources of Data’ tab.

  # Consumption vs. production-based CO₂ emissions shares (based on GCP & UN)
  
  Variables include each country, region and World Bank income group's share of the global population; production-based (territorial); and consumption-based (trade-adjusted) carbon dioxide emissions. 
  
  This was calculated by Our World in Data based on CO₂ figures produced by Le Quéré et al. (2017). Global Carbon Project. This is given as production (territorial) emissions in addition to trade-adjusted consumption-based emissions. Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.
  
  Note that consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries; although those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total. Each country's share of world emissions are based on the share of the global total minus categories termed 'bunkers' and 'statistical differences' (which include cross-boundary emissions such as international travel and shipping.
  
  Calculation of each country's share of the global population is calculated using national and global population figures from the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPPP, 2018).

  # Consumption-based CO2 emissions - Global Carbon Project (2018)
  
  Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.
  
  The underlying source is an updated version of the paper by "Peters et al. (2011). Growth in emission transfers via international trade from 1990 to 2008." This updated data is available in the latest version of the Global Carbon Budget. 
  
  Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

  The variable 'milex' has been split into two variables as the currency of expenditure changes pre and post-1914. Pre-1914, military expenditure is in thousands of UK pounds and post-1914 it is in thousands of US dollars. Both expenditure figures are measured in current prices.
  
  For values in real prices: Deflated the pre-1914 series to give the value in 1900 UK £s and  deflated the post-1914 series to give the value in 2000 US $s. Uses Quandl data.

  # Country Income Classification - World Bank (2017)
  
  –The Atlas methodology is used to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national incomes. The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a country's exchange rate for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, adjusted for the differences between the rate of inflation in the country and that in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro area. A country's inflation rate is measured by the change in its GDP deflator. The inflation rate for the above countries, representing international inflation, is measured by the changes in the SDR deflator. (Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are the IMF's unit of account.)
  
  – Data on Serbia & Montenegro, prior to 2006 have been allocated to the sovereign states of Serbia, and Montenegro, respectively. Similarly, the 15 post-Soviet States have been allocated the USSR's classification for 1990. This includes Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

  Further notes: 
  </br>
  - All sources rely on the same conceptual definition, but in many cases sources do not agree with one another. Because of this, year to year changes should be interpreted with caution. You can read more about literacy measurement here: https://ourworldindata.org/how-is-literacy-measured
  </br>
  - The World Bank's WDI estimates correspond to UNESCO Institute for Statistics. OxLAD estimates come from several underlying sources (see original documentation for more details).
  </br>
  - For Paraguay in 1982, the OxLAD data source was favoured over the World Bank (WDI) as the latter estimates literacy rates at 78.46%, a much lower estimate compared to neighbouring years for which there was data available.

  Estimates rely on data from multiple sources:
  - For European countries, the data comes from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Marriage_and_divorce_statistics#Fewer_marriages.2C_more_divorces">Eurostat dataset</a>.
  - For the US the series is composed of data taken from three sources: <a href="https://hsus.cambridge.org/HSUSWeb/HSUSEntryServlet">Carter et al. (2006)</a> for the period 1920 - 1995; the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2006/compendia/statab/126ed/vital-statistics.html">US Census Bureau (2007)</a> for the period 1996 - 2004; and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage-divorce.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fmardiv.htm">CDC</a> for the period 2005 to present.
  - For other non-European countries that are OECD members, the data comes from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm">OECD Family Database</a>.
  - For all other countries the data comes from the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/marriage/data.asp">UN World Marriage Database</a> ,
  
  (<em>NB. The source for each observation can be found in the metadata spreadsheet <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/marriage-rates-final-metadata-standard.xlsx">here</a></em>)
  
  
  Notes regarding comparability:
  1. The US Census Bureau (2007) figures include estimates for some States through 1965 and also for 1976 and 1977 and marriage licenses for some states for all years except 1973 and 1975. From 1978, estimates include nonlicensed marriages in California. Prior to 1960, figures exclude Alaska and Hawaii. 
  2. The CDC has revised the rate of marriages for 2016 due to revised figures for Illinois.  Rates for 2001-2009 have also been revised and are based on intercensal population estimates from the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Populations for 2010 rates are based on the 2010 census.
  3. For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards. 
  4. Data for New Zealand include civil unions.
  5. Germany includes the German Democratic Republic. This series was favoured instead of 'Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)' as when compared with the OECD series matched more closely.
  6. Footnote by Turkey. The information in this document with reference to « Cyprus » relates to the southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”.
  7. Footnote by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Commission.. The Republic of Cyprus is recognized by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
  8. Estimates from the UN World Marriage Database have a 10-year reference period. This means that estimates labeled as "1985", for example, correspond to data collected over the period 1980-1989.

  # Cumulative CO2 emissions (OWID based on GCP & CDIAC (2018))
  
  Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. 
  
  This is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. 
  
  Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.
  
  Our World in Data has also defined the following regions as: 
  – "Asia & Pacific (other)" is Asia and Oceania totals minus China and India
  – "Americas (other)" is North, Central, South America and the Caribbean minus the USA
  – "Europe (other)" is Western and Eastern Europe minus the EU-28.
  
  "Statistical differences" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as "statistical differences".
  
  Our World in Data have renamed the category "bunker fuels" as "International transport" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.
  
  Historical data for Australia in CDIAC from 1820 until 1860 reports negative CO2 emissions. In this dataset, pre-1860 data for Australia has been removed.
  
  Data from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). Reference: Tom Boden and Bob Andres (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); Gregg Marland (Appalachian State University). Available at: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/
  
  Data from 1959 onwards is sourced from the Global Carbon Project (2018).

  # Current GDP (British pounds) - Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016)
  
  Due to the long-run nature of Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) time series, GDP estimates are compiled using a variety of sources. The top five sources, which together make up more than a third of the dataset (approx 11,864 observations out of 31,541) are from the following sources: World Bank (2015) (8513 obs); Mitchell (2017a,b,c) (1714); Barbieri and Keshik (2012) (1037 obs); Smits et al (2014) (335 obs); and Dincecco and Prado (2013) (265 obs). 
  
  A comprehensive list of GDP sources and full references can be found here: http://www.cepii.fr/PDF_PUB/wp/2016/wp2016-14.pdf, Table 7, page 19. 
  
  Similarly, CEPII's exchange rate variable is set to the British pound value of one local currency unit. Again, it draws on a range of sources of which the top five are reported here: International Monetary Fund (2012) (4394 obs); extracted from Wikipedia (2448 obs); Barbieri and Keshk (2012) (2005 obs); Officer (2014) (1752 obs); and Denzel (2010) (1750 obs).

  # DRAFT Military expenditure data (COW & SIPRI 2017)
  
  The National Material Capabilities (NMC) dataset, published by COW Project, contains variables that are central in describing a country’s power. The quality and quantity of data vary across countries and time periods, which makes it not well-suited for time-series analyses. OWID uses two of their variables - military expenditure (milex) and military personnel (milper) - to construct this dataset. BOE exchange rates and US CPI are used to convert milex figures in constant US$. This allows comparison among countries in different years but with limitations. Finally, to extend milex series till 2016, figures from SIPRI’s Military Expenditure Database are spliced for the years 2013-2016.
  
  Hosts of the NMC dataset, Professor Michael Greig and Professor Andrew Enterline, explain that the aim was to create a dataset which allowed for annual comparisons of the relative capabilities of states/countries in the international system. So NMC dataset is best for cross-sectional comparisons. Detailed description of original data is available here: http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/nmc-codebook-v5-1. However, military expenditure figures have been converted in constant currency units previously such as by SIPRI, World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) and Military Expenditures and Economic Growth, Castillo et al (2001). Thus, to be transparent and acknowledge data limitations, we explain below the way OWID has generated this dataset.

  Military Personnel (milper)
  Milper values were originally given in thousands. OWID multiplies those figures by thousand to produce the variable ‘Military personnel’. NMC dataset also reports total population of the country in a given year. The variable ‘Military personnel relative to total population’ is generated by taking the ratio of ‘Military personnel’ and ‘Total population’.
  Military Expenditure (milex)
  NMC dataset converted expenditure figures from national currency into a standard unit. However, it reports milex in thousands British pounds sterling prior to 1914 and in thousands US dollars thereafter. The decision to report milex in such a way reflects that UK was a dominant power before 1914 and US after that. We reconstruct milex data in the following way:
  We multiply milex values from NMC dataset by thousands. It gives military expenditure in British pounds from 1816-1913 and in US dollars from 1914-2012. We add to these, the milex values from SIPRI’s Database in US$ from 2013-2016. 
  Even though SIPRI provides milex values from 1949-2016, NMC dataset by COW Project is more complete for the overlapping years. Thus, we choose NMC dataset as our main dataset.
  To convert milex into current US$ from 1816-1913, we use exchange rates from Bank of England (BOE) dataset. As a result, we get military expenditures in current US$ for the entire period 1816-2012. 
  Please note that we use BOE exchange rates because the original COW exchange rates are not available. While we are aware that using a different exchange rates for the period preceding 1914 introduces noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in any systematic way. It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates already had.
  Then, we use US Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 1816-2016 to adjust for inflation. OWID uses 2015 as the base year i.e. price deflator in 2015 = 1. After dividing milex in current US$ by price deflator, we get military expenditure in constant 2015 US dollars. 
  SIPRI also provides milex data in constant 2015 US$. While the OWID reconstructed figures follow the same trend, two series are different. It is due to difference in methodologies used. SIPRI uses individual country’s CPI to first adjust for inflation, and then market exchange to convert national currency in 2015 US$. If there were perfect markets, both approaches should give same result as exchange rates would reflect changes in relative value of each currency over time.
  Finally, for all three variables - Military expenditure, Military expenditure in current US$ and Military expenditure in constant US$ - we take their ratio relative to the total population to express variables in per capita terms.

  # Daily caloric supply per capita -  FAO (2017) & Various historical sources
  
  Data for all countries spanning the timeframe from 1961 is based on daily caloric supply (kcal/person/day) as reported by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Daily caloric supply is defined as the average per capita caloric availability. Note that this indicates the caloric availability delivered to households but does not necessarily indicate the number of calories actually consumed (food may be wasted at the consumer level). FAO data can be found at its FAOstats database (food balance sheets): http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS [accessed 2017-07-18]
  
  Data from 1961-1991 for Post-Soviet states are assumed to be in line with reported data for the USSR over this period.
  
  Data for the USSR is determined to be highly uncertain, and likely represents an overestimate of caloric supply prior to its dissolution. The FAO admits its estimates of USSR availability are highly uncertain, and comparative sources suggest the same. Detailed discussion on this topic is published by José Luis Ricón (Artir), available here: https://nintil.com/2016/05/11/the-soviet-union-food/
  
  Data estimates for a select number of countries extends earlier than 1961. The data sources are noted below:
  
  The data for Belgium, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway between 1800 and 1960 is taken from Table 5.5 (Daily calorie consumption per head in western Europe, 1800–1960) in Floud, Fogel, Harris, and Hong (2011) – The Changing Body Health, Nutrition, and Human Development in the Western World Since 1700.

  # Death rate from energy production - Markandya & Wilkinson (2007)
  
  Data was derived from Table 2 in Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007). Electricity generation and health. The Lancet, 370(9591), 979-990. Available at: doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61253-7 (accessed 2017-05-05).
  
  This data was originally derived by the authors based on methodology developed by the European Commission's ExternE report. European Commission. ExternE: Externalities of Energy: Methodology 2005 Update. EUR 21951. Brussels: European Commission, 2005. Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/kina_en.pdf (accessed 2017-05-05)
  
  This data is based on European energy production standards and practices. Data includes both acute and chronic effects (chronic effects account for between 88% and 99% of total deaths). Figures for nuclear include all cancer-related deaths. The figures for death rates per TWh for cancer-related nuclear deaths by Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007) are calculated on a theoretical basis using a method called the ‘linear, no-threshold model’. The basis of this model assumes that the number of deaths is directly and linearly proportional to the dosage of radiation; additionally it assumes there is no lower limit or “safe” level of exposure, meaning individuals are at risk even at very low doses.
  
  We have estimated the hypothetical number of deaths which would have occurred globally in 2014 if the world's energy demand was met through a given source. This was calculated by multiplying the death rate per energy source by the IEA's estimate of global energy production in 2014 of 159,000TWh (Available at: https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf)

  # Death rates (non age-standardized) from non-communicable diseases - IHME (2016)
  
  The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the non age-standardized death rates by cause and risk factors for any given year.
  
  It is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: "the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury." Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.
  
  Data here relates to the non age-standardized death rates from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - that is, the cause of death rather than particular risk factors which may increase the likelihood of NCDs. Non age-standardized death rates correct for differences in population size by reporting the number of deaths per 100,000 people. However, they do not correct for changes in the age distribution of the population.
  
  Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are further clarified as follows:
  'Dementia' refers to the number of deaths attributed to Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
  'Cardiovascular disease' refers to rheumatic and ischemic heart diseases.
  'Respiratory diseases' includes deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Pneumoconiosis diseases.
  'Cancers' includes all forms of cancer, also referred to in the GBD database as 'neoplasms'.
  'Digestive diseases' refers to all deaths resultant from ulcer diseases, pancreatitis, gallbladder, bowel disease, gastritis and intestinal diseases.

  # Death rates by cause and risk factor - Global Burden of Disease (2016)
  
  The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the age-standardized death rates by cause and risk factors for any given year.
  The age-standardized death rate measures the incidence of mortality per 100,000 individuals, normalised to a standardized population size and age distribution. This standardisation allows for fair comparison of death rates by correcting for differences in population size and changes in the age distribution across countries and through time. This gives an appropriate measure of the probability of death for any given individual from a certain risk factor or cause.
  It is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: "the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury." Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.
  Risk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of death. For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability of lung cancer. In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.
  In order to identify and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of causes of death and risk factors. Many of the variables are straightforward causes of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities. However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we have instead presented the IHME's attributed figures by risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking. Identification of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates.
  Causes and risk factors are further clarified as follows:
  'Outdoor air pollution' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone.
  'Drug use' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol]. This is distinguished from 'drug disorders' which refers to direct death as a result of drug dependence and drug abuse.
  'Alcohol disorders' refers to death as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from 'alcohol use', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.
  'Road accidents' includes deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.
  
  'Nutritional deficiencies' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.

  'Dementia' refers to the number of deaths attributed to Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
  
  'Cardiovascular disease' refers to rheumatic and ischemic heart diseases.
  
  'Respiratory diseases' includes deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Pneumoconiosis diseases.
  
  'Cancers' includes all forms of cancer, also referred to in the GBD database as 'neoplasms'.
  
  'Digestive diseases' refers to all deaths resultant from ulcer diseases, pancreatitis, gallbladder, bowel disease, gastritis and intestinal diseases.

  # Deaths per TWh energy production, all sources (Markandya & Wilkinson; Sovacool et al.)
  
  Death rates from energy production is measured as the number of deaths by energy source per terawatt-hour (TWh) of production. 
  
  This data combines two sources: Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007) assessed the death rates from accidents and air pollution major energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass). Sovacool et al. (2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1950 to 2014.
  
  Nuclear and biomass sources therefore have two values. Nuclear data from Markandya & Wilkinson (2007) includes both major nuclear accidents (with exception to Fukushima, since it occurred after publication) plus occupational deaths from mining, transport and other routes of exposure. The authors note that the nuclear deaths occur "largely at the mining, milling, and generation stages". Sovacool et al. (2016) do not consider some of these sources of occupational deaths and only include deaths from accidents – Chernobyl, Fukushima and Kyshtym.
  
  Biomass figures from Markandya & Wilkinson (2007) include deaths from air pollution. Sovacool et al. (2016) consider only deaths from accidents in biomass energy production. Death rates here are therefore much lower.

  # Deaths per TWh from low-carbon energy (Sovacool et al., 2016)
  
  Number of deaths attributed to energy-related accidents of low-carbon energy sources, measured as the number of deaths per terawatt-hour of production.
  
  Sovacool et al. (2016) developed a database of energy-related accidents over the period from 1950 to 2014. They define an accident as: "an unintentional incident or event at an energy facility that led to either one death (or more) or at least $50,000 in property damage."
  
  This database was developed based on a series of academic databases (including ScienceDirect and EBSCO host) as well as the internet (using Google and Safari).

  # Dietary macronutrient compositions - FAO (2017)
  
  Dietary compositions calculated by the OWID author (Hannah Ritchie) based on food supply statistics from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization database: FAOstat.
  
  The FAO provide annual figures from 1961 by country on daily caloric supply, fat supply (in grams), and protein supply (in grams). To calculate the daily per capita supply of carbohydrates, we assumed an energy density by macronutrient of 4 kcal per gram of both protein and carbohydrate and 9 kcal per gram of fat (based on established nutritional guidelines reported by the FAO). The daily supply of carbohydrates was therefore calculated as:
  
  ((Daily supply of kcal)-(Daily supply of protein * 4 + Daily supply of fat * 9)) / 4
  
  The quantity of calories from each macronutrient was then calculated based on the energy density figures given above (e.g. calories from protein was calculated by multiplting the daily supply of protein in grams by 4).
  
  The share of calories derived from each macronutrient could then be calculated by dividing the number of calories derived from a given macronutrient by the total daily caloric supply.
  
  Protein of animal origin includes protein supplied in the form of all meat commodities, eggs and dairy products, and fish & seafood. Protein of plant origin was dervied as the difference between total protein supply and that of animal origin.

For example, for China, the figure in the chart corresponds to “Value of merchandise imports in US from China” minus “Value of merchandise exports from China to the US”. In all cases, values correspond to current US dollars. Asymmetries arise for different reasons, including the fact that exports are usually recorded in FOB prices, while imports are recorded in CIF prices.

  # Differences in population estimates - OWID based on UN vs US Census Bureau
  
  This dataset was calculated by OWID based on population estimates from the UN Population Division (2017) and US Census Bureau.
  
  Absolute differences measure the absolute difference in regional and global population estimates from the UN Population Division and US Census Bureau. Figures were calculated as the annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus population estimates from the US Census Bureau.
  
  Relative differences measure this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e. (UN population - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).
  
  Negative figures therefore represent lower UN estimates vs. US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive values indicate higher UN estimates).

  This metric measures the share of adults aged 15-49 years old who convey discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV. This is measured through population-based surveys (demographic, household surveys and cohort cluster surveys).
  
  To assess discriminatory attitudes, these studies ask participants a simple yes/no question of "Would you buy fruits or vegetables from a local market seller if you knew the seller had HIV?". The given percentage indicates the share of respondents who answered "no". Respondents who were unfamiliar on the meaning of HIV were excluded from results of this analysis.

An index value of zero represents the average moisture conditions observed between 1931 and 1990 at a given location. A positive value means conditions are wetter than average, while a negative value is drier than average. 
  
  Index values from locations across US have been averaged together to produce the national or regional values.
  
  Positive values represent wetter-than-average conditions, while negative values represent drier-than-average conditions. A value between -2 and -3 indicates moderate drought, -3 to -4 is severe drought, and -4 or below indicates extreme drought.

  # ECI Country Rankings (Observatory of Economic Complexity (2016) and the Atlas of Economic Complexity (2016))
  
  The Economic Complexity Index takes data on exports, and reduces a country’s economic system into two dimensions: (i) The number or ‘diversification’ of products in the export basket, and (ii) the quality, or ‘ubiquity’ of products in the export basket.
  
  To measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export matrix. That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.
  
  From this matrix, ‘diversification’ is obtained from the distribution of country exports across products (i.e. the sum across columns for each row); while ‘ubiquity’  is given by the share of product exports contributed by each country (i.e. the sum across rows for each column).
  
  To condense both dimensions into a single metric, the ECI further reduces the information in the matrix, such that countries with similar exports are close together in the ranking. 
  
  Loosely speaking, lower ECI scores correspond to countries that export very few different types of products (i.e. export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). 
  
  By this logic, Germany has a high ECI score because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities. 
  
  The following visualization shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world. Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings
  
  As we can see, there is a clear pattern – richer countries tend to have similar economic structures, and these structures allow them to produce and export a varied basket of sophisticated products.
  
  But what about countries endowed with rare natural resources, like petroleum, which would make a country’s export basket less ubiquitous, and hence misleadingly be assigned a more favourable ECI ranking? If a country exporting petroleum can only produce a few other products, then the low ubiquity for their export basket can be explained by these natural resources, and the ECI ranking is corrected by the country’s inability to produce different types of products. However, if this country can also produce a diverse range of other goods, then low ubiquity correctly indicates greater economic complexity which is reflected in the ranking. Hence, information on diversity can correct for the information of ubiquity, and vice versa.
  
  The data here comes from the Economic Complexity Index scores published by the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity. These are different to those published by the Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity. As far as we are aware, the discrepancies stem from differences in the way each sources clean the underlying cross-country trade data. You can explore differences between these two data sources here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-country-rankings-comparison?country=KOR.

  Estimated number of deaths from earthquake events. This is estimated as the total number from the earthquake event plus secondary impacts (such as a tsunami triggered by an earthquake).
  
  A significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.
  
  Our World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake deaths by country/location per year. 
  
  Due to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record.

  The cornerstones of economic freedom are (1) personal choice, (2) voluntary exchange coordinated by markets, (3) freedom to enter and compete in markets, and (4) protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.
  
  Individuals have economic freedom when property they acquire without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others and they are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others.

  The authors standardized the scores to the PISA test scale but divided the score then by 100. The PISA test scale has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. 
  
  The test scores are not given for a particular year, but instead are the average of all standardized math and science test scores of the international student achievement tests in which that country participated. The first of which is from 1964 and the last is from 2003 – but in general most results come from the later period.

  # Elephant population (AfESG &AsESG, 2019)
  
  Data on elephant populations was gathered on two species: the African elephant, and the Asian elephant.
  
  African elephant population data was primarily gathered from the African Elephant Database. Available at: https://www.iucn.org/ssc-groups/mammals/african-elephant-specialist-group/african-elephant-database. This database is maintained by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) and Great Elephant Census. National data is available in its African Elephant Status reports: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7a8w3kk6r9hzm0r/AfESG%20African%20Elephant%20Status%20Report%202016.pdf?dl=1.
  
  Prior to 2013, this data was collected and reported on the basis of the DPPS method, where estimates were given as 'Definite', 'Probable', 'Possible' and 'Speculative'. In its 2013 and 2015 estimates, this method was simplified and changed to 'Estimates' and 'Guesses'. To provide comparative statistics over time, here we have taken historical data coded as 'Definite' to be equivalent to estimated elephant populations. In 2013 and 2015 data (which is given by both methods for comparison), these figures are comparable; this therefore seems like a reasonable assumption. It may however introduce some additional uncertainty.
  
  Long historical estimates for Africa are taken from the Great Elephant Census: http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/background-on-conservation.
  
  Figures for some countries on 'carcass ratio' are also provided. The carcass ratio is the number of  dead elephants observed during 
  the count, as a percentage of the total population. Carcass ratios of more than 8 percent are considered to indicate poaching at a high enough level to cause a declining population.
  
  Asian elephant population data is sourced primarily from the Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG); UN FAO and national records. Latest estimates are available here: https://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/2017/AsERSM%202017_Final%20Report.pdf
  
  These have been supplemented with longer records for Nepal (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0e.htm); China (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124834); Vietnam (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0f.htm); and India (https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/23637/7/07_chapter%201.pdf).
  
  Time-series estimates of total Asian elephant populations are not widely available. The IUCN estimates there were around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. Today that figure is around 45,000. Source: http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/asian_elephants/.

  # Emissions air pollutants over long-term (DEFRA & EPA)
  
  Data is presented as total UK and US emissions of air pollutants from all anthropogenic/human sources measured in tonnes per year. Also provided is an index of emissions, normalised to emissions in the first year of data (1970/1980 or 1990) 1970. In other words, annual emissions in 1970 are denoted as equal to 100; values below 100 therefore indicate a fall in emissions; values above 100 indicate an increase in emissions.
  
  PM10 and PM2.5 are used to denote emissions of particulate matter (PM) measuring less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5).

  # Endangered Species - IUCN (2019)
  
  This dataset presents figures on the numbers of described species, assessed species, and threatened species, and the best estimate of the percentage of threatened species, by major groups of organisms (2000–2019), according to the IUCN Red List.
  
  Total described species is the number of species identified by various scientific sources, which are shown here: https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/2019_2_RL_Table_1a_v2.pdf. These figures should be used with extreme care as these are not the currently accepted totals for all taxonomic groups.
  
  Total assessed species is the number of species that have undergone an extinction risk assessment. Extinction risk has been assessed for about 5% of the world's described species, and so this dataset should not be interpreted as a full and complete assessment of the world's biodiversity. Assessment efforts have focused on those species that are likely to be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased (i.e., the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate).
  
  Total threatened species is the number of species assessed as "critically endangered", "endangered", or "vulnerable", according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which are generally based on the population size and geographic range: https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-2001-001-2nd.pdf
  
  Estimated threatened species is the estimated percentage of species that are threatened. The proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups (i.e., >80% of species have been evaluated). This figure is presented as a best estimate, defined as the percentage of threatened extant species if data deficient species are equally threatened as data sufficient species.

  # Environmental impacts of food (Poore & Nemecek, 2018)
  
  Data is based on an the largest meta-analysis of food system impact studies to date, from Poore & Nemecek's 2018 study.
  
  The authors note the following about the scope of the studies included in this meta-analysis:
  "We derived data from a comprehensive meta-analysis, identifying 1530 studies for potential inclusion, which were supplemented with additional data received from 139 authors. Studies were assessed against 11 criteria designed to standardize methodology, resulting in 570 suitable studies with a median reference year of 2010. The data set covers ~38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption'.
  
  Environmental impacts are compared across several metrics: land use (m2), greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes of CO2-equivalents), eutrophying emissions (grams of PO4-equivalents), freshwater withdrawals (liters), and scarcity-weighted water (liters) which are freshwater withdrawals weighted for local water scarcity.
  
  All comparisons here are based on the global mean value per food product across all studies.
  
  Comparisons can be made in functional units: here all comparisons are made as impacts per kilogram of product.
  
  Comparisons are also made on the basis of nutritional units in two categories: per 100 grams of protein and per 1000 kilocalories.
  
  Poore & Nemecek (2018) quantified a range of footprints in nutritional units:
  (1) protein products, which are compared per 100 grams of protein. Protein products include all meats, seafood, dairy, nuts, tofu and pulses. Grains are also compared here – despite being a low-quality source of protein – since a large share of global protein is derived from cereals.
  
  (2) grains and staples, which are compared per 1000 kilocalories.
  
  Poore & Nemecek (2018) do not provide data per 100g protein for food products which are not protein-rich, or kilocalorie measures for non-stale crops. To provide footprints for all products Our World in Data have filled these gaps by calculating footprints per nutritional unit using food composition factors from the FAO INFOODS International Database and Food Balance Sheets:
  http://www.fao.org/3/X9892E/X9892e05.htm#P8217_125315
  http://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/tables-and-databases/international-databases/en/
  
  Footprints expressed per kilogram of food product can be converted to per unit protein or kilocalorie using data on the nutrient density of food products.
  
  Where nutritional footprints are available from Poore & Nemecek (2018), this data has been used. Where there were gaps, this data has been calculated by Our World in Data.

  # Estimated average age at marriage, by gender (UN and OECD)
  
  
  <strong>Definition and sources by country</strong></br>
  For OECD countries, figures correspond to mean age at first marriage from the OECD Family Database. For other countries, figures correspond to Singulate Mean Age at Marriage from the UN World Marriage Data 2019.  
  
  The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM) is an indirect estimate of the average age at first marriage, and is calculated from survey data on marital status by age.
  
  To calculate the SMAM, the UN World Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census and survey estimates. For comparability, we have chosen to report only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country. 
  
  The following is a list of sources underlying our UN estimates, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS. 
  
  A full breakdown of the source used for each observation in this dataset can be found <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/oecd-un-mix-final-metadata-stand.csv">here</a>.
  
  <strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage</strong></br>
  The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.
  
  <strong>OECD country series notes</strong></br>
  - Estimates for Australia, New Zealand and the United States provide the median, rather than mean age at first marriage
  - For Mexico, data refer to all marriages and not only first marriage
  - For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards.
  - For New Zealand data include civil unions. From 2007 onwards, data include those who transferred their civil union to a marriage. 
  - From 2014 onwards, data for the United Kingdom include marriages between same-sex partners.

  # Estimated average age at marriage, by gender (UN)
  
  
  <strong>Definition and sources by country.</strong></br>
  The estimates of average age at marriage in this dataset correspond to what is known as "singulate mean age at marriage". This is an estimate of the average number of years lived by a cohort of women or men before their first marriage. It is an indirect estimate, obtained from survey data on marital status by age.
  
  The source of the estimates is the UN World Marriage Database (2019). 
  
  The UN World Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census and survey estimates. For comparability, we have chosen to use only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country. 
  
  The following is a list of underlying sources, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS. 
  
  A full breakdown of the source used for each observation in the UN dataset can be found <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/un-smam-19-metadata_country_stan.csv">here</a>.
  
  
  <strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage: </strong></br>
  <em>The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.</em>

  # Estimated percent of women who are married or in a union (UN)
  
  The estimates and projections of the number of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who are married or in a union were prepared based on data from individual countries on an age-specific basis (for five-year age groups 15-19 to 45-49).
  
  For the purpose of this data, women who are currently married or in a union are either (i) women who have been married and are not divorced, widowed or separated; or (ii) women who are living in a cohabiting union.
  
  The question usually asked in censuses and surveys is on the marital status or union status of an individual.
  
  The definitions of marital status and union status of individuals differ by the source of data, country and time period. For example, in the United Nations principles and recommendations for census taking, only registered partnerships and consensual unions that are legal and binding under law should be reported. However, there is considerable variation among the definitions and terminology used in surveys. The Demographic and Health Surveys, one of the major sources of data on marital and union status, ask individuals whether they are married or ‘living together’ with a partner; however, in countries with low prevalence of cohabiting unions, the survey question is normally limited only to marriage.
  
  For a breakdown of countries by region see the UN Methodology page <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/">here</a>.

  # Ethnographic and Archaeological Evidence on Violent Deaths
  
  This dataset contains estimates of the frequency of violent deaths due to murder or war in modern and prehistoric state and non-state societies, based on archaeological and ethnographic evidence.
  
  For modern state societies, homicide rates are routinely published by statistical offices or other state agencies, and reliable data on war deaths are published by research institutes. For non-state societies, we generally have two different sources of information: for the more recent past (since the late 19th century), abundant ethnographic evidence is available; for the more distant past, we have evidence from archaeological sites and skeletal remains.
  
  The main sources for this dataset are as follows:
  - Bowles (2009) – Did Warfare Among Ancestral Hunter-Gatherers Affect the Evolution of Human Social Behaviors?. In Science, 324, 5932, 1293–1298.

  The figures presented for each 50-year interval refer to evidence drawn from within ten years of the date in question. For example, the figures for 1650 are based on evidence found  for the period 1640-1660. When available evidence refers to years outside the 20 year periods (e.g. for 1625 and 1680) an interpolated estimate is made using the straight-line method, for the intervening 50-year interval date, 1650. 
  
  Regional definitions are as follows: 
  North and west consist of: Scandinavia, England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands, and Belgium
  Central: Germany, France, and Switzerland
  Mediterranean: Northern Italy, Central Italy, Southern Italy, Spain, and Portugal
  Eastern: Austria-Bohemia, and Poland
  
  Europe consists of the North and west, Central, Mediterranean, and Eastern regions.
  The Low Countries (also known as the Benelux countries) include Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
  The rest of northern Europe includes all countries not already included as part of the British Isles or the Low Countries.
  
  De Vries excludes Russia and Orthodox Europe noting for "the period 1500-1800 the cities of the Russian and Ottoman empires possessed characteristics so distinctive that it would be misleading to include them in a single study with western and central Europe. [...] Hungary [...] is excluded because of the difficulty gaining information for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when most of Hungary was under Ottoman control. [...] Lithuania's exclusion and that of the Baltic states is required by the combination of insufficient information and boundary changes."

  # Executions by country - Amnesty International
  
    Amnesty Interntional note: 
  "Amnesty
  International reports only on executions, death sentences and other aspects of the use of
  the death penalty, such as commutations and exonerations, where there is reasonable
  confirmation.
  In many countries governments do not publish information on their use of the
  death penalty. In Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty is
  classified as a state secret. During 2016 little or no information was available on some
  countries – in particular Laos, North Korea (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),
  Syria and Yemen – due to restrictive state practice and/or armed conflict.
  Therefore, with only a few exceptions, Amnesty International’s figures on the use of the death
  penalty are minimum figures.
  The true figures are likely to be higher. Where the organization
  obtains fuller information on a specific country in a given year this is noted in Amnesty International's report.
  In 2009 Amnesty International stopped publishing its estimated figures on the use of the
  death penalty in China. Amnesty International always made clear that the figures it was able
  to publish on China were significantly lower than the reality, because of the restrictions on
  access to information. Amnesty International’s decision to stop publishing data reflected
  concerns about how the Chinese authorities misrepresented Amnesty International’s
  numbers. Since 2009 the organization challenged China to publish information on the use of
  the death penalty. China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty. However,
  available information indicates that thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death
  in China each year."

  # Extensions in life expectancy (OWID calculations based on UN Population Division (2017 Revision))
  
  The increase in life expectancy in 1955 was calculated as follows: Life expectancy in 1955 minus life expectancy in 1950 provides the total increase in life expectancy across this five year interval (x). The increase in life expectancy in hours per day is given by x multiplied by 365 divided by 5x365. This total is then multiplied by 24. The increase in life expectancy in months per year is given by x divided by 5, multiplied by 12.
  
  The increase in life expectancy between 1950-2015 has been calculated as follows: Life expectancy in 2015 minus life expectancy in 1950 provides the total increase in years over the 65 year interval (y). The increase in life expectancy in hours per day is given by y multiplied by 365 divided by 65x365. This total is then multiplied by 24.

  # Extreme Poverty 2030 Projections by SSP - Crespo et al. (2018)
  
  Data on extreme poverty projections by country and region are sourced from the Nature publication by Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2018). This data is also presented visually at the World Poverty Clock: http://worldpoverty.io/index.html
  
  Extreme poverty is defined by the international poverty line, set at a threshold of $1.90 per person per day, which is adjusted for inflation (by normalising to 2011 dollars), and corrected for cross-country price differences (PPP).
  
  The UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.1 is to end extreme poverty by 2030. 'Ending extreme poverty' is assumed when a country reaches an extreme poverty level below 3% of the total population.
  
  Scenarios of future extreme poverty rates were assessed and modelled by Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2018) using a combination of the IMF World Economic Outlook, and multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). 
  
  The SSPs are defined broadly as follows:
  - SSP1: low challenges for both climate change adaptation and mitigation resulting from income growth which does not rely heavily on natural resources and technological change, coupled with low fertility rate and high educational attainment.
  
  - SSP2: the benchmark scenario and assumes the continuation of current global socioeconomic trends at the global level. 
  
  - SSP3: low economic growth coupled with low educational attainment levels and high population growth at the global level are the main elements of the narrative, which is characterized by high mitigation and adaptation challenges.
  
  - SSP4: presents a narrative of worldwide polarization, with high income countries exhibiting relatively high growth rates of income, while developing economies present low levels of education, high fertility and economic stagnation.
  
  - SSP5: presents a scenario with high economic growth (and therefore low adaptation challenges) coupled with high demand for fossil energy from developing economies, but with high global CO2 emissions.
  
  SSP2 is defined as the baseline 'business-as-usual' scenario. 
  
  The categories of 'extremely fragile', 'fragile' and 'non-fragile' have been added for reference based on the OECD (2018) States of Fragility framework. This framework measures the fragility of countries based on multiple political and socioeconomic indicators. More information on this fragility measure can be found at the OECD (2018) report.

  # Extreme Poverty in absolute numbers - Ravallion (2016) updated with World Bank (2019)
  
  According to the 'International Poverty Line' set by the United Nations people are considered to live in extreme poverty when living on less than 1.90 international-$ per day. International $ are adjusted for price differences between countries and for price changes over time (inflation).
  
  This visualization can be found in Ravallion (2016) – The Economics of Poverty: History, Measurement, and Policy. Oxford University Press. 28 January 2016. 736 Pages.
  
  We have updated the visualization from Ravallion (2016) using the same sources the author relies on: Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) for the historical estimates and the World Bank for data from 1981 onwards. 
  
  All poverty estimates 1981 and later are taken from the World Bank's Povcal Net: iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/ (downloaded in February 2019).
  All data from 1980 and earlier is taken from Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) – Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820–1992. In American Economic Review, 92, 4, 727–748. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) state that 'the poverty lines were calibrated so that poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly with estimates from other sources’; here we rely on the midpoint of the two series published by Bourguignon and Morrison. 
  
  The absolute number of the world population is taken from the OurWorldInData world population data set: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth.

  # Extreme Temperatures in US (NOAA)
  
  The U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the United States. While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.
  
  Unusually high and low temperatures measure the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered “unusually cold” and the warmest 10 percent are “unusually hot.” For example, if last year’s summer highs were the 10th warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year’s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2015 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2016 for winter (December of the previous year through February).

  # Extreme precipitation in US (NOAA)
  
  The metric of extreme single-day precipitation events measures the share of land area which experienced over a threshold percentage of precipitation in an extreme single-day burst. 
  
  The metric of an unusually high precipitation year is measured on the basis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). which compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data. If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period, it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than normal will receive a positive score. The more precipitation (compared with normal), the higher the SPI score. The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a standard scale. 
  
  The data on unusually high precipitation shows the share of land area in the US which experienced an SPI value of 2.0 or above (well above normal) in a given year.
  
  Nine-year smoothed average trends for these metrics are also available.

Details on how we combined these sources can be found in this online table (https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/OECD-historical-female-participation-OWID.xlsx).
  
  It is important to bear in mind that OECD estimates correspond to population ages 15+, while other estimates correspond to population 14+. Also, for France 1962-1966 we assigned missing values where the OECD.stat file reports zero.

  Gapminder's sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/
  
  It notes its data sources during three key periods of time:
  
  — 1800 to 1950 (and in some cases also years after 1950): Gapminder v6 which were compiled and documented by Mattias Lindgren.
  
  — 1950 to 2014: In most cases we use the latest UN estimates from World Population Prospects 2017 published in the file with Annually interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx , accessed on September 2, 2017.
  
  — 2015 – 2099: We use the UN forecast of future fertility rate in all countries, called median fertility variant.
  
  Version 12 of the dataset extends back to the year 1800. Version 6 of Gapminder's fertility series includes data for a few countries further than 1800. We have included more historic data from Version 6 for Finland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. All data from 1800 onwards is from Version 12; data from pre-1800 is from Version 6.
  
  There are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950. To develop full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates. This series presents the selective Gapminder dataset: we have removed data points which were estimated by Gapminder with high uncertainty and instead only include those from published sources or the United Nations dataset. 
  
  We also publish the full dataset from Gapminder for users looking for a complete series. However, we should highlight that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty. This dataset can be accessed here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-rate-complete-gapminder

This series presents the full Gapminder dataset: both those from published estimates and estimates made by Gapminder with high uncertainty. This is provided so users have access to the full dataset.
  
  However, for our main long-term series on fertility rates at Our World in Data we exclude the highly uncertain data points which are not backed up with published estimates within the literature. Users looking for a series with less uncertainty should refer to that instead.

  # Five year cancer survival rates - Allemani et al. 
  
  Data is based on the percentage of those diagnosed with cancer who survive at least five years after the date of diagnosis. This is measured across the top 10 common malignancies in adults (aged 15-99), and leukaemia in children (aged 0-14). This share is age-standardized assuming a constant age distribution of the population to compare between countries and with time.
  
  The dates presented here are given as single-year but represent average net survival rates over a multi-year diagnosis period. Data here labelled '1999' represents average survival rates over the period 1995-1999; '2004' for 2000-2004; '2009' for 2005-2009.

  # Food Insecurity - FAO
  
  Food insecurity is defined by the UN FAO based on the use of Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) global reference scale. This was developed by the FAO in 2014 and developed across 140 countries.
  
  The FEIS measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity.

  # Food miles by transport method (Poore & Nemecek, 2018)
  
  Data is based on an the largest meta-analysis of food system impact studies to date, from Poore & Nemecek's 2018 study.
  
  The authors note the following about the scope of the studies included in this meta-analysis:
  "We derived data from a comprehensive meta-analysis, identifying 1530 studies for potential inclusion, which were supplemented with additional data received from 139 authors. Studies were assessed against 11 criteria designed to standardize methodology, resulting in 570 suitable studies with a median reference year of 2010. The data set covers ~38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption'.
  
  A tonne-kilometre, abbreviated as tkm, is a unit of measure of freight transport which represents the transport of one tonne of goods (including packaging and tare weights of intermodal transport units) by a given transport mode (road, rail, air, sea, inland waterways, pipeline etc.) over a distance of one kilometre.

  Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors, and is divided by GDP.

  # Fossil fuel vs. low-carbon primary energy shares (OWID based on BP, 2018)
  
  The share of global primary energy produced from fossil fuel versus low-carbon sources based on BP Statistical Review data. This is based on each source's share of primary energy demand in terrawatt-hours. Our World in Data have converted fossil fuel sources (reported in million tonnes of oil equivalent) to TWh using a conversion factor of 11.63.
  
  These shares do not include traditional biomass.
  
  - 'Fossil fuels' is equal to the sum of global coal, natural gas and crude oil consumption.
  - 'Renewables' is equal to the sum of solar, wind, hydropower and 'other renewables' (which is the sum of other renewable sources including geothermal, modern biofuels, wind and tidal). 
  - 'Low-carbon' is the sum of renewable and nuclear energy consumption.

  Description by the World Bank: "GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2011 international dollars.

  The original Maddison Project dataset expresses the population "in thousands". In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid expressing it "in thousands".
  
  The Maddison region definitions were adapted from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm under the heading "Historical Statistics" and the file titled: Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) 
  
  To calculate average real GDP per capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population. This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population.

  # GHG emissions per capita (EDGAR, 2019)
  
  Total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent are composed of CO2 totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and Savannah burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6).
  
  Figures on per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated by Our World in Data based on total GHG emissions, and population data published in the World Bank, World Development Indicators. 
  
  The World Bank (WDI) publishes figures on annual GHG emissions by country, sourced from the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)/Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). And population data sourced from the UN World Population Prospects.
  
  Per capita GHG emissions per year was calculated by dividing total annual emissions by country by its population in the given year.
  
  Per capita GHG emissions per day was calculated by diving annual per capita figures by 365 (and converting from tonnes to kilograms by multiplying by 1000).

  # GISTEMP Temperature Anomaly
  
  The temperature anomaly is measured relative to the 1951-1980 global average temperature.
  
  The GISTEMP analysis recalculates consistent temperature anomaly series from 1880 to the present for a regularly spaced array of virtual stations covering the whole globe. Those data are used to investigate regional and global patterns and trends. Country-level values were created by averaging all grid cells whose centroids were within the border of a country. Area weighted measures were weighted by the area of the grid cell when averaging the grid cells and population weighted averages used gridded population data from 2015 created by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN (http://dx.doi.org/10.7927/H4X63JVC).

  Full reference: Wetterstrand KA. DNA Sequencing Costs: Data from the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) Available at: www.genome.gov/sequencingcostsdata [accessed 2017-07-11].
  
  The NHGRI programme describe genome sequencing costs relative to two metrics, quoted below:
  
  "(1) "Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence" - the cost of determining one megabase (Mb; a million bases) of DNA sequence of a specified quality;
  
  (2) "Cost per Genome" - the cost of sequencing a human-sized genome."
  
  Cost data from the NHGRI is presented either biannually or seasonally for each year. Here we have summarised this data on an annual basis by calculating the yearly average cost.
  The number of DNA base pairs sequenced per US$ was calculated by dividing 1 by the metric, "Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence", and multiplying by 1 million.

  # Global CO2 emissions - CDIAC and UN Population
  
  Per capita CO2 emissions have been calculated based on the combination of global emissions data from CDIAC (described below), and UN Population Prospects data.
  
  Population data was derived from: The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) collected the data by earlier publications. For the 'OurWorldInData'-series we used various sources: The data for the period before 1900 are taken from the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE). The data for the World Population between 1900 and 1940 is taken from the UN puplication 'The World at Six Billion'. The annual data for the World Population between 1950 and 2015 is taken from the UN's World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision. It is the series 'Total Population - Both Sexes' online available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/.
  
  Emissions data have been sourced from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC) database. Emissions data have been converted from units of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2) using a conversion factor of 3.67.
  
  CDIAC denote a "statistical difference" component which has been included in this data. This statistical difference represents the difference between estimated global CO2 emissions and the sum of national totals. Estimates of CO2 emissions show that the global total of emissions is not equal to the sum of emissions from all countries. This is introduced in several cases: emissions within international territories, which are included in global totals but not attributed to individual countries; inconsistent national reporting where global import and export data is imbalanced; and differing treatment of non-fuel uses of hydrocarbons.
  
  Full methodology on global, regional, national and statistical difference estimations can be found in Le Quere et al. (2016): Le Quéré, C., Andrew, R. M., Canadell, J. G., Sitch, S., Korsbakken, J.

  The carbon budget refers to the maximum quantity of carbon which can be released to maintain a 50 percent probability of global average temperature rise remaining below two-degrees celcius (the target set within the UN Paris climate agreement).
  
  This has been measured relative to the quantity of carbon which would be released if all fossil fuel reserves were burned without the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The difference between the two is defined as 'unburnable carbon'.

  # Global Hunger Index- IFPRI (2018)
  
  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger globally, regionally, and by country. To reflect the multidimensional nature of hunger, the GHI combines four component indicators into one index score. An increase in a country's GHI score indicates that the hunger situation is worsening, while a decrease in the score indicates an improvement in the hunger situation.
  
  The four indicators used to calculate the GHI are:
  
  - Undernourishment: the proportion of undernourished people as a percentage of the population
  
  - Child wasting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from wasting (low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition);
  
  - Child stunting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from stunting (low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition); and
  
  - Child mortality: the mortality rate of children under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments)
  
  The formula and weighting of these four indicators in relation to the final index score can be found at: http://library.ifpri.info/files/2016/09/BK_2016_GHI_appendix_a_w.pdf [accessed 24th July 2017]
  
  The 2016 GHI has been calculated for 118 countries for which data on the four component indicators are available and where measuring hunger is considered most relevant. GHI scores are not calculated for some higher-income countries where the prevalence of hunger is very low.

  # Global Primary Energy Consumption - Vaclav Smil (2017) & BP Statistics (2019)
  
  This data comprises of a combination of data from Appendix A of Vaclav Smil's Updated and Revised Edition of his book, 'Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives' (2017). & BP Statistical Review of World Energy.
  
  All data prior to the year 1965 is sourced from Smil (2017). All data from 1965 onwards, with the exception of traditional biomass is sourced from BP Statistical Review. Smil's estimates of traditional biomass are only available until 2015. For the years 2016 onwards, we have assumed a similar level of traditional biomass consumption. This is approximately in line with recent trends in traditional biomass from Smil's data.
  
  Our World in Data has normalised all BP data to terawatt-hours (TWh) using a conversion factor of 11.63 to convert from million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to TWh.
  
  Data represents primary energy (rather than final energy) consumption. 'Other renewables' represents all renewable sources minus solar, wind, and hydropower (e.g. geothermal, wave and tidal, and modern biofuels).

  In 69 countries, the reporting year of tax revenue coincides with the calendar year, whereas 11 have different reporting years.  Where the GDP reporting year differs from the calendar year, annual GDP estimates are calculated by aggregating quarterly GDP estimates corresponding to each country’s fiscal (tax) year.

  Disaster-related deaths from EMDAT (OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database) have been normalised by OurWorldinData to global population size based on HYDE (1900-1949) & UN (1950 onwards) population estimates. This provides data in terms of deaths per 100,000 people.
  
  The data presented here includes all categories classified as "natural disasters" (distinguished from technological disasters, such as oil spills and industrial accidents). This includes those from drought, floods, extreme weather, extreme temperature, landslides, dry mass movements, wildfires, volcanic activity and earthquakes.
  
  The combined set of "all natural disasters" also includes disasters defined as "insect infestations", however this has not been included as a discrete dataset due to low impact numbers.

  # Global deaths by cause and risk - Global Burden of Disease (2017)
  
  The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the absolute number of deaths across mortality cause and risk factors for any given year.
  It is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: "the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury." Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.
  Risk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of death. For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability of lung cancer. In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.
  In order to identify and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of causes of death and risk factors. Many of the variables are straightforward causes of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities. However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we have instead presented the IHME's attributed figures by risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking. Identification of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates.
  Causes and risk factors are further clarified as follows:
  'Outdoor air pollution' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone.
  'Drug use' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol]. This is distinguished from 'drug disorders' which refers to direct death as a result of drug dependence and drug abuse.
  'Alcohol disorders' refers to death as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from 'alcohol use', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.
  'Road accidents' includes deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.
  
  'Nutritional deficiencies' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.

The series measures the percentage of population aged over 15 enrolled in formal education. The estimate for 1820 is labelled a ’Best Guess' in the OECD publication and should be considered as such.
  The data for 1970 and later is taken from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (2015). It shows the share of the population (older than 15 years) that has attained at least some basic education.

  # Global energy shares (substitution method) (BP, 2018)
  
  The share of global energy consumption, based on the 'substitution method' of energy accounting. The 'substitution method' attempts to correct for the inefficiencies in thermal (fossil) energy production by applying a correction factor for this inefficiency.
  
  The 'substitution method' provides an approximation (although not perfect fit) to final energy demand. In the progression towards a low-carbon energy system, the substitution method provides a helpful overview of the approximate final energy demand which would be required by low-carbon sources.
  
  BP factors into its reporting an efficiency correction factor of 0.38 for thermal energy sources. Calculating energy shares from all sources in their Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) from BP provides an approximation of the substitution method.
  
  Note that applying a single conversion factor introduces some uncertainty since the appropriate conversion will vary by specific fuel type and region. However, for analysis of the global energy outlook, it provides a good approximation.
  
  Here, 'other renewables' includes all renewable sources minus solar, wind, hydropower and traditional biomass. Traditional biomass has been excluded from these calculations. 'Low carbon' sources is the sum of total renewables and nuclear energy. 'Fossil fuels' is the sum of coal, crude oil and natural gas.

  Data denotes the global warming potential (GWP) over a 100-year timescale for greenhouse gases relative to the GWP of carbon dioxide (which is denoted as 1). Global warming potential measures the relative warming impact of one unit mass of gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide. For example, a GWP value for gas 'x' of 25 would mean one tonne of 'x' would have 25 times the warming impact of one tonne of carbon dioixde.
  
  GWP100 values are used to convert greenhouse gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metric by multiplying emissions in mass terms by their respective GWP100 factors.
  
  In the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5), it presents GWP both with and without climate change feedback effects. For some gases, for example methane, this can introduce significant uncertainty. In the case of methane, the GWP100 value without feedbacks is 28; with feedbacks this increases to 34. 
  
  In its official figures the IPCC adopts GWP100 factors without climate change feedbacks. Here we present the same figures without climate change feedbacks to maintain consistency with the IPCC.

  # Global year of last polio case plus certification status - GPEI (2017)
  
  The definition of WHO Regions can be found here: http://www.who.int/about/regions/en/ 
  
  Because the certification of being polio-free is done by the WHO by region and not by country (and only three years after the last case of polio was recorded), you see three polio statuses: endemic, polio-free (WHO Region not yet certified) and polio-free with the WHO Region of the country also certified polio-free.

  # Government Expenditure – IMF based on Mauro et al. (2015)
  
  Government expenditure estimates correspond to non-interest government expenditures. The authors als note: "The database covers an unbalanced panel of 55 countries (24 advanced economies—by present day definition from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook classification—and 31 nonadvanced) over 1800–2011. The data consist of government revenue, non-interest government expenditure, and the interest bill (and thus also the overall fiscal balance and the primary balance), as well as gross public debt, all expressed as a share of GDP...About half of the observations for the fiscal variables in our dataset are drawn from various cross-country sources, including the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) and International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the OECD Analytical Database...We hand-collected the other half of the data from country-specific sources, such as official government publications or economic histories that included public finance statistics."
  
  IMF data on government expenditure does not include interest paid on debt payments. In order to derive government expenditure with interest paid on debt included, the datasets "government expenditure, percent of GDP" and "interest paid on public debt, percent of GDP" from the IMF database.
  
  This data is therefore inclusive of interest on debt payments.

  # Government expenditure and learning outcomes
  
  This dataset was compiled to compare the government expenditure per primary student ($PPP) with learning outcomes. Because of the patchy nature of the government expenditure data as obtained from the World Bank EdStats Dataset, the most recent available expenditure data were used while 2006 was used as a cut-off point. 
  
  The measure of learning outcome used is the share of students either achieving or not achieving a minimum proficiency benchmark. Achievement outcomes come from standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional tests. In order to maximize coverage by country, tests have been harmonized and pooled across subjects (math, reading, science) and levels (primary and secondary education). Higher proficiency benchmarks that represent the missing share of 100% are students that reached intermediate or advanced proficiency levels. See source for details on proficiency benchmarks.

  The source notes: "For most countries central government finance data have been consolidated into one account, but for others only budgetary central government accounts are available. Countries reporting budgetary data are noted in the country metadata. Because budgetary accounts may not include all central government units (such as social security funds), they usually provide an incomplete picture. In federal states the central government accounts provide an incomplete view of total public finance. Data on government revenue and expense are collected by the IMF through questionnaires to member countries and by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Despite IMF efforts to standardize data collection, statistics are often incomplete, untimely, and not comparable across countries."

  # HALF Index (Land Use) - Alexander et al. (2016)
  
  This data is based on the published work of Alexander et al. (2016). Human appropriation of land for food: The role of diet. Full reference below.
  
  The authors calculate the HALF (Human appropriation of land for food) index, which measures the percentage of total land area we would need for the global population to consume the average diet of any given country. This is based on population and dietary figures from FAO 2011 data.
  
  OWID have re-calculated these figures as the percentage of habitable land area (rather than total land area). This corrects for land which is either barren or glacial land and could not be used for agriculture or other land uses. To correct for this factor, we have assumed that 71% of total land area as habitable (with 10% glaciers and 19% barren land); figures based on WWF (2016). Living Planet Report 2016.
  
  A HALF Index value of 100% means that 100% of global habitable land area would be needed as agricultural land to provide for global diets. Values >100% are not physically possible within global land constraints.

  According to the source this measure "relies on a precise and narrow conception of transparency: the disclosure of policy-relevant information by the government to the public. In addition, our measure reflects an objective view of transparency that is readily reproducible by others.
  
  The HRV Index focuses on the availability of credible aggregate economic data. It does so by examining patterns of missing data and treating transparency as the latent term which best reflects the tendency to disclose."

  # HadCRUT Temperature Anomaly
  
  For land regions of the world over 4800 monthly station temperature time series are used and CRUTEM4 (land) is created. For marine regions, sea surface temperature (SST) measurements taken on board merchant and some naval vessels are used and HadSST3 (ocean) is created. HadCRUT4 combines both datasets.
  
  The temperature anomaly is measured relative to the 1961-1990 global average temperature. Country-level values were created by averaging all grid cells whose centroids were within the border of a country. Area weighted measures were weighted by the area of the grid cell when averaging the gridd cells and population weighted averages used gridded population data from 2015 created by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN (http://dx.doi.org/10.7927/H4X63JVC).

  # Halons consumption - UNEP
  
  Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.

  # Health Expenditure and Financing - OECDstat (2017)
  
  Per capita health expenditure here is measured in 2010 international dollars.
  
  The definition of health spending given by the OECD is the following: "Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services (i.e. current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments. Health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance (“public”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“private”). This indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing (“public”, “private”, “out-of-pocket”) and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs)."

  # Heights of Early Europeans - based on Hermanussen (2003) and the NCD RisC (2017)
  
  This series combines figures from two published datasets.
  
  Data on human heights in Early Europeans in the Eastern Mediterranean region was sourced from Stature of Early Europeans - Hermanussen (2013). These heights are provided for specific historical periods: where values are provided over a time range (for example, 10000-8000 BC), we have have allocated a date in the middle of this range (9000 BC, in this example).
  
  To compare how historical heights have evolved into the 19th and 20th century, we have combined this series with data for Europe and Central Asia in the period 1896-1996 from the NCD RisC.

  # Hidden Hunger Index in pre-school children - Muthayya et al. (2013)
  
  The authors note: "Hidden Hunger Index (HHI-PD) for preschool-age children is calculated as the average of three deficiency prevalence estimates: preschool children affected by stunting, anemia due to iron deficiency, and vitamin-A deficiency. The three components were equally weighted (HHI-PD score = [stunting (%) + anemia (%) + low serum retinol (%)]/3).
  
  The HHI-PD score ranged between the best and worst possible scores of 0 and 100, respectively. Applying arbitrary cut-offs, HHI-PD scores between 0 and 19.9 were considered mild, 20-34.9 as moderate, 35-44.9 as severe, and 45-100 as alarmingly high. Highly developed countries with a 2007 Human Development Index (HDI) score above 0.9 (n=41) were assumed to have a low prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, and were therefore excluded from this analysis.
  
  Data on micronutrient deficiencies used in this index relate to national-level analysis and surveys over the period 1999-2009.

  # Historical Index of Human Development (without GDP) - Prados de la Escosura
  
  The Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) is a composite statistic (index) that measures key dimensions of human development:
  - life expectancy
  - literacy
  - educational enrolment
  – and per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
  
  This particular metric presents the assessed HDI normalised without the variable of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), so includes life expectancy, literacy and schooling rates only.

  # Historical gender equality index - How Was Life? (2014)
  
  The HGI is constructed by following Hausmann et al. (2012) who created the Global Gender Gap index (GGG). The composite index includes the gender differences in four dimensions, health, socio-economic resources, household and politics. Health is measured by life expectancy and sex ratios whereas socio-economic resources are captured by average years of education and labour force participation. The gender disparities in the household are captured by the marriage ages and the data on distribution of parliamentary seats between men and women is used as an indication of gender disparities in the politics. Each of these variables is presented in female/male ratio. Before creating the composite index, values above 1 were truncated to be 1 except for sex ratio where the equality benchmark is set to be 0.944. For health and socio-economic resources, we have two indicators capturing these dimensions. We have given a weight to each of these indicators, so that the variable with higher standard deviation would not get a higher weight in the sub-index. Thus we normalize the variables in each sub-index by first determining what a 1% point change would translate into in the standard deviations (calculated by dividing .01 by the standard deviation of each variable), then determining the weight to each variable. As a final step, the total of the four sub-indexes was taken, divided by four and multiplied by 100 for the ease of interpretation. A higher score in our index thus highlights less gender inequality in favour of women. A more detailed discussion of the composite index is provided in Dilli et al. (2014).
  
  Note: this is an expanded version compared to the one released in 2014. In line with the procedure required for the How was life report (Carmichael et al. 2014), only decennial averages for the 25 clio-infra countries were reported. This dataset contains all our observations.

  # Historical urban fraction estimates and total computed urban areas - HYDE 3.1 (2010)
  
  Authors' note on the data sources used: "Urban/rural fractions for all countries were derived from the UN after ad 1950 (UN, 2008b). Earlier historical urbanization estimates for Europe were derived from De Vries (1984), Bairoch et al. (1988), Chandler (1987), for Canada after ad 1890 from Urquhart and Buckley (1965), for China from Rozman (1973) and Maddison (1995), for Colombia from Etter et al. (2006), USA from Dodd (1993), all other countries were estimated similar to De Vries (1984), which data yielded roughly a factor 10 lower in ad 1700 compared with the 1950 value of the UN."

  # Homelessness and Precarious Housing - OECD (2016)
  
  Different OECD countries adopt different definitions of homelessness. A full table of definitions used for the purpose of data collection in the OECD can be found in Annex 1 of OECD Affordable Housing Database (2016) (https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HC3-1-Homeless-population.pdf)
  
   
  
  The variable Homelessness – OECD corresponds to homelessness estimates including exclusively (i) people living in the streets or public spaces without a shelter that can be defined as living quarters; (ii) people in emergency accommodation with no place of usual residence, who move frequently between various types of accommodation; and (iii) people living in accommodation for the homeless, including homeless hostels, temporary accommodation and other types of shelters for the homeless.
  
   
  
  The variable Precarious housing – OECD corresponds to  homelessness estimates including the three categories mentioned above, plus (iv) people living in institutions and (v) people living temporarily in conventional housing with family and friends.
  
   
  
  All estimates correspond to the period 2011-2015. The following table provides details regarding the exact year in each case.

  # Homelessness prevalence - Toro et al. (2007)
  
  Interviews took place at different points in time within and across countries. All interviews took place in the period 1999-2003. 
  
  The source provides the following information regarding the data-collecting process:
  
  "Random samples of 250–435 adults were interviewed by telephone in five different nations (N = 1,546): Belgium, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the United States. The interview included questions on respondent attitudes, knowledge, and opinions regarding homelessness; respondents’ own personal experiences with homelessness and homeless people; and demographic characteristics of the respondents.
  
  Respondents’ personal experiences with homelessness were assessed by querying whether they had ever considered themselves homeless or in another precarious housing situation, following up with items directed at ascertaining the age at which they experienced homelessness, the duration of the episode of homelessness, and whether they were literally homeless (slept in a shelter, in a park) or 'precariously housed' (slept at a friend’s house because they had no other place to go)."
  
  We report estimates only for literal homelessness.

  # Human Capital Index (World Bank, 2018)
  
  The Human Capital Index (HCI) combines indicators of health and education into a measure of the human capital that a child born today can expect to obtain by her 18th birthday, given the risks of poor education and health that prevail in the country where she lives. The HCI is measured in units of productivity relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, and ranges from 0 to 1. A value of x on the HCI indicates that a child born today can expect to be only x x100 percent as productive as a future worker as she would be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. 
  
  Ranging between 0 and 1, the index takes the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve full
  health (defined as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and complete her education potential
  (defined as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18). 
  
  HCI is calculated based on the metrics of probability of survival to age 5, expected years of school, harmonized test scores, learning-adjusted years of schooling, stunting and adult survival rates.

  The original dataset includes the country ids 666.001, 666.002, and 666.003. These correspond to different human rights reports which were produced for distinct areas in Israel (Israel, pre-1967 borders Israel, occupied territories Palestinian Authority). Because of technical limitations they cannot be shown in these visualisations and shown is only the 'Israel' series.

  # Human Rights Scores – Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014), Fariss (2019)
  
  The dataset used here is "Latent Human Rights Protection Scores Version 3" (v3.01, 2019-05-28), first developed by Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014) and subsequently updated by Fariss (2019). 
  
  The Latent Human Rights Protection Scores—which we simply call Human Rights Scores here—have values from around −3.8 to around 5.4 (the higher the better).
  
  To construct the Human Rights Scores, Fariss (2019) uses data from nine sources. These are listed here under "Data publisher's source". For more about these sources, see Fariss's (2019) Appendix A, "Observed Human Rights Variables Descriptions and Citations", available at https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20190514094205785-0852:sup-mat:20190514094205785-0852:S000305541900025Xsup001.pdf

  Data on Continental US Hurricane Impacts/Landfalls as published in the HURDAT (Hurricane Database) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
  
  This data runs from 1851 through to the latest annual data.
  
  Hurricanes are categorised by the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) which classifies by five categories (1 being the lowest; 5 the highest) based on the intensity of sustained winds. This scale estimates potential property damage. Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage.
  
  The NOAA notes that because of the sparseness of towns and cities before 1900 in some coastal locations along the United States, the data prior to 1900 may not be complete for all states.

  # Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) consumption - UNEP
  
  Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.

  Data is based on the hypothetical scenario where the total global population had the same carbon dioxide production footprint as the average citizen of a given country.
  
  Figures were derived by multiplying the average per capita CO2 footprint (sourced from CDIAC, referenced below) in 2014, by the UN estimated global population in 2014 of 7,265,786,000.

  # Hypothetical meat consumption - OWID based on FAO & UN
  
  This is a hypothetical variable derived by Our World in Data which asks the question: "what would global meat production have to be if everyone in the world was to consume the average per capita amount of a given country?" e.g. "how much meat would we need if everyone in the world consumed the same amount of meat as the average UK citizen?".
  
  This was derived by multiplying global population figures from the UN Population Division (2017 Revision) by per capita meat supply of a given, as published by the UN FAO.

  # Incidence of child labor (England, Italy, US, World) - Cunningham and Viazzo (1996) and others
  
  Incidence of child labour in datasets for England and Italy is based on the percentage of children (aged 10-14) recorded as working at least one hour of work per week (thus defined as "children in employment"). Data for the United States is for children aged 10-13 only. Figures for the US have been calculated as the weighted-average of gender-specific incidences of labour, based on the male:female ratio (10-13 year-olds) from reported population figures.
  
  Data for the global level is based on the definition of full-time child labour (which excludes children participating in light part-time work). World ILO-EPEAP data from 1950-1995 is based on children aged 10-14. World ILO-IPEC data from 2000-2012 broadens this definition to those aged 5-17. Estimates are based on census and national survey data.

  –The Atlas methodology is used to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national incomes. The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a country's exchange rate for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, adjusted for the differences between the rate of inflation in the country and that in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro area. A country's inflation rate is measured by the change in its GDP deflator. The inflation rate for the above countries, representing international inflation, is measured by the changes in the SDR deflator. (Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are the IMF's unit of account.)
  – Data on Serbia & Montenegro, prior to 2006 have been allocated to the sovereign states of Serbia, and Montenegro, respectively. Similarly, the 15 post-Soviet States have been allocated the USSR's classification for 1990.

  The following definitions are taken from World Bank's World Development Index description in 'Details'.
  
  Price level ratio of PPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate:
  
  "Purchasing power parity conversion factor is the number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as a U.S. dollar would buy in the United States. The ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States. PPP conversion factors are based on the 2011 ICP round.
  
  SourceWorld Bank, International Comparison Program database."
  
  GDP per-capita - PPP int-$ adjusted (2015 current prices): "GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current international dollars based on the 2011 ICP round.
  
  SourceWorld Bank, International Comparison Program database."
  
  GDP per-capita - US $ market exchange (2015 current prices): "GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

  Gendered inheritance practices for immovables in 1920 are obtained from the Murdock data, while 1980 and 2000 are from the World Bank.
  
  Information on inheritance practices at the start of the 20th century comes from George Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas (1969).  To compare Murdock's figures to contemporary data available from the World Bank’s Fifty Years of Women’s Legal Rights database, a dichotomous scheme had to be used where 0 indicates inequality and 1 equality.

  # International migrant stock (share of population) – World Bank (2015)
  
  International migrant stock is the number of people born in a country other than that in which they live. It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data. Based on United Nations Population Division, Trends in Total Migrant Stock: 2008 Revision.

  # Labor productivity in cotton spinning (Chapman (1972))
  
  The easiest way to illustrate the improvements in labor productivity in cotton spinning over time is to reproduce data on labor productivity from Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule, from which the measure of OHP (operative hours to process 100 lbs of cotton) is applied to other technologies, as shown. [Please see table 2 on page 20 for the original data.]
  
  Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule provides a historical introduction of the invention of the spinning mule in the 18th century. The spinning mule was worked by hand with the spinner manually controlled all its operations. It was around 1825 that Richard Roberts invented the ‘quadrant winding motion’ that enabled the machine to operate automatically.

  # Labour productivity - The Conference Board Total Economy Database (2016)
  
  The source – TED – states: "Estimates of working hours involve serious measurement problems and international comparability is difficult. Even individual countries often provide differing estimates, which are variously based on labor force surveys or establishment surveys. An advantage of estimates based on labor force surveys is that they are usually quite comprehensive. These estimates include adjustments for overtime, sickness, etc. A disadvantage, however, is that often they slightly overestimate actual hours worked. Figures based on establishment surveys usually only cover hours paid (which may include overtime), and require further adjustments to account for various types of absence." 
  The source furthermore explains that "the measure used in TED is hours actually worked, so it includes paid overtime and excludes paid hours that are not worked due to sickness, vacation and holidays, etc."

  Data on global land use breakdown was developed based on land cover figures published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), available at its statistical database: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home [accessed 10th October 2017].
  
  Global land use breakdown data has also been visualised and published at: https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/#breakdown-of-global-land-area-today
  
  Here, we have attempted to visualise the extent of global land surface area equivalent to each land cover category using World Bank country area figures.
  
  For example, the surface of North America, Latin America and the Caribbean combined is approximately equivalent to the areal extent of global forests.

  # Land sparing from cereal yields - World Bank (2017)
  
  This dataset has been derived by OWID based on World Bank World Development Indicator (WDI) variables.
  
  The original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was "Land under cereal production (hectares)", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as: "Land under cereal production refers to harvested area, although some countries report only sown or cultivated area. Cereals include wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded."
  
  World/global figures from this World Bank dataset include boundary issues for land under cereal production prior to 1991: this data does not include land within the Former Soviet Union (USSR) and therefore underestimates global land use. To aim to correct for this, we have summed the total land area of production for all countries within the former USSR from 1992, and have added this value to the global total for all years from 1961-1991. Data from 1991 onwards has not been changed.
  
  To derive the land spared from cereal yield increases, we have calculated the area of land which would have been required to maintain global cereal production at actual rates based on the WDI variable "Cereal production (metric tons)". This has been calculated as the area needed to maintain this level of cereal production assuming global average yields had remained constant at 1.42 kilograms per hectares (as reported by the World Development Indicators).

  The temperature anomaly is measured relative to the 1951-1980 global average temperature. Country-level values were created by averaging all grid cells whose centroids were within the border of a country. Area weighted measures were weighted by the area of the grid cell when averaging the grid cells and population weighted averages used gridded population data from 2015 created by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN (http://dx.doi.org/10.7927/H4X63JVC).

  # Land under cereal production index - World Bank (2017)
  
  Land under cereal production index was derived by OurWorldinData based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).
  
  The land under cereal production index measures annual land use for cereal production as an index to land use in 1961, the first year of the original dataset. This index was calculated by dividing land used for cereals (which is measured in hectares) in any given year by land use in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in land use vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.
  World/global figures from this World Bank dataset include boundary issues for land under cereal production prior to 1991: this data does not include land within the Former Soviet Union (USSR) and therefore underestimates global land use. To aim to correct for this, we have summed the total land area of production for all countries within the former USSR from 1992, and have added this value to the global total for all years from 1961-1991. Data from 1991 onwards has not been changed.

  This dataset presents estimates of the expectancy and population by country for 1800, 1950, 2015, and 2019.
  
  For life expectancy in 1800, we use data from version 9 of Gapminder, the latest as of 2019, which is based on 100 sources compiled by Mattias Lindgren. (https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/)
  
  For life expectancy in 1950, 2015, and 2019, we use data published by the United Nations Population Division. (https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Metadata/Documentation/)
  
  For population, we use Our World in Data's population dataset, from our page on World Population Growth, which was constructed by Our World in Data based on the HYDE database (2016) and UN's World Population Prospects (2019).

  # Life expectancy - Riley (2005) and UN 
  
  Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on estimates by James C. Riley and the United Nations Population Division.
  
  From 1770-1949, we use data from a study by Riley, which draws from over 700 sources to estimate regional and global life expectancy at birth from 1800 to 2001.
  
  Riley estimated life expectancy before 1800, which he calls "the pre-health transition period". "Health transitions began in different countries in different periods, as early as the 1770s in Denmark and as late as the 1970s in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa". As such, for the sake of consistency, we have assigned the period before the health transition to the year 1770. "The life expectancy values employed are averages of estimates for the period before the beginning of the transitions for countries within that region. ... This period has presumably the weakest basis, the largest margin of error, and the simplest method of deriving an estimate."
  
  For 1950-2015, we use data published by the United Nations Population Division, since they are updated every year. This is possible because Riley writes that "for 1950-2001, I have drawn life expectancy estimates chiefly from various sources provided by the United Nations, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, and the Human Mortality Database". 
  
  For the Americas from 1950-2015, we took the population-weighted average of Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean, using UN Population Division estimates of population size.

  Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on estimates by James C. Riley, Clio Infra, and the United Nations Population Division.

  # Life expectancy at age 10, 1750-2100 - United Nations Population Division and Human Mortality Database (2015)
  
  The data file used is called “Life Expectancy at exact age x (ex) - Both Sexes” on the website given under “Mortality indicators”. This original data file has life expectancy at multiple ages for every country and different regions. We use only the countries and “World” data for age 10.
  Each country has a life table from which we extracted the life expectancy at age 10 (column ex, row where Age is 10 for each country.)
  We combined the information from the UN Population Division (UNPD) and the Human Mortality Database (HMD) using an R script. In the final data set, UNPD values are used for 1950-2100, and HMD values are used pre-1950, where available. The data set uses the first year of the period to graph the data, i.e. the e10 value for 1950-1954 is graphed at 1950.
  
  We omitted data from the first period for which data is available for each country, because often this first period was not a full 5 years long. For instance, the life table for Australia begins with the 4-year period 1921-1924, and every subsequent period is a full 5 years long. With data manipulation or extrapolation, this first data point can be included in the future.

  # Life expectancy – James Riley for data 1990 and earlier; WHO and World Bank for later data (by Max Roser)
  
  Changes to Riley's data by Max Roser:
  
  I have assigned the 'Life expectancy before health transition' from Riley's data to the year 1770 for all world regions. The reason for doing this is that 1770 is the earliest available data from his paper and I chose that as the start year for the chart.
  
  Then I took Riley's estimate for 'Period when earliest health transition in region began' and assigned the 'Life expectancy before health transition' to the mid-point of that period.
  
  From then on I show Riley's data until 1990 where his dataset ends.
  
  
  
  For 2000 and later estimates:
  
  Africa: WHO for world region 'Africa'
  
  Americas: WHO for world region 'Americas'
  
  Asia: World Bank population weighted average of all countries in Riley's definition of Asia http://www.lifetable.de/cgi-bin/countryR.plx?c=Asia
  
  Former Soviet Union countries: World Bank population weighted average of former Soviet countries ( Russian Federation, Ukraine, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kazakhstan, Georgia, Republic of Azerbaijan, Republic of Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Republic of Latvia, Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Republic of Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Republic of Estonia.)
  
  Europe: Riley's definition of Europe is this: http://www.lifetable.de/cgi-bin/countryR.plx?c=Europe The data here is from the World Bank

  # Lighting efficiency in UK - OWID based on Fouquet & Pearson (2007)
  
  Data was calculated by OWID based on published figures by Fouquet & Pearson (2006). Calculated as the weighted-average efficiency of lighting in the United Kingdom. Calculated based on percentage share and efficiency data of lighting sources from Fouquet & Pearson (2006). Data represents the national average efficiency, calculated as the sum of (% share * efficiency) of each source.
  
  For example: (share of lighting from candles * efficiency of candles) + (share of lighting from whale oil * efficiency of whale oil) + (share of lighting from kerosene * efficiency of kerosene).
  
  Efficiency is measured in lumen-hours per kilowatt-hour.

  # Literacy rate (% of total respondents) - DHS Surveys
  
  The adult literacy rate is defined as the percentage of survey respondents, aged 15 and above, who can read. The 155 literacy variable indicates whether a respondent who attended primary schooling can read a whole or part of a sentence showed. A respondent who attended secondary education or higher are coded 2 as well as respondent who could read a whole sentence. Possible categories include: 0 - cannot read at all; 1 - able to read only parts of sentence; 2 - able to read whole sentence; 3 - no card with required language; 4 - blind/visually impaired. Our estimates exclude those in categories 3 and 4. 
  
  The methodology for constructing this variable is as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>The DHS surveys for men and women were pooled</li>
  <li>Created a dichotomous literacy variable, combining categories 1 'able to read only parts of sentence' with 2 'able to read whole sentence' to represent literate respondents, and 0 'cannot read at all' for illiterate respondents</li>
  <li>Summed the total number of respondents who were classified as literate and the total number of respondents, for each country in each year</li>
  <li>Calculated the literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of people in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
  <li>Calculated the female literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of females in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
  <li>Calculated the male literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of males in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
  </ul>
  
  The number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year. Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution. 
  
  DHS surveys are conducted approximately every 5 years in phases. The literacy variable (155) is available from phase 4 onward. Hence, Phase 7 corresponds to 2015; phase 6 to 2010; phase 5 to 2005; and phase 4 to 2000.  As this dataset brings together a number of countries across various phases, the year has been assigned according to the survey phase. Note the actual year the survey was conducted in a country may differ to the year assigned, but the survey will have been undertaken within the five year interval between each phase.

  # Living Planet Index, Freshwater - WWF (2016)
  
  The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of global biological diversity based on population trends of vertebrate species from around the world. The Living Planet Database (LPD) currently holds time-series data for over 18,000 populations of more than 3,600 mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian species from around the world, which are gathered from a variety of sources such as journals, online databases and government reports. Using a method developed by ZSL and WWF, these species population trends are aggregated to produce indices of the state of biodiversity.
  
  The index value is measured relative to species' populations in 1970 (i.e. 1970 = 1).
  
  To calculate an LPI, a generalised additive modelling framework is used to determine the underlying trend in each population time-series. Average rates of change are then calculated and aggregated to the species level. For the global LPI, the method of aggregation has recently been revised to include a weighting system which gives trends from more species-rich systems, realms and groups more weight in the final index.

  Public health expenditure:
  
  According to the definition given by the World Bank "Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds."
  This scatterplot was inspired by Reeves et al. (2015)
  
  Public health expenditure per capita was calculated combining WDI data on Health expenditure, public (%GDP) and GDP per capita, PPP (current international $).

  Tax revenues per capita:
  
  According to the definition given by the World Bank "Tax revenue refers to compulsory transfers to the central government for public purposes. Certain compulsory transfers such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions are excluded. Refunds and corrections of erroneously collected tax revenue are treated as negative revenue."
  This scatterplot was inspired by Reeves et al. (2015).
  
  Tax revenue per capita was calculated combining WDI data on Tax revenue (% of GDP) and GDP per capita, PPP (current international $).

  Data published by the Joint Center for History and Economics has been sourced from a range of authors and publications, referenced below.
  
  The authors note:
  
  1. Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;
  
  2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;
  
  3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.

  # Long-term per capita fossil fuels - OWID based on UN, Gapminder, BP, Etemad & Luciana
  
  Average per capita fossil fuel production - for coal, oil and gas - was calculated by OWID based on published population and national fossil fuel production data.
  
  Per capita fossil fuel production was calculated by dividing national production of coal, oil or gas by the total population in any given year.
  
  Population data was sourced from a combination of Gapminder sources (for data pre-1950), and from 1950 onwards was sourced from the UN Population Division's 2017 Revision.

  The original Maddison Project dataset expresses the population "in thousands". In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid expressing it "in thousands".
  
  The Maddison region definitions were adapted from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm under the heading "Historical Statistics" and the file titled: Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) 
  
  To calculate average real GDP per capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population. This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population.

  US estimates are based on Hacker (2010) for the period 1780 to 1890. The year 1790 refers to the period 1790-99; see Table 8: New Life Tables for the White Population of the United States, 1780-1900 for the original data consulted for this period. The US Social Security Administration data is used from 1900 to today.
  
  For other countries,  estimates are based on the Human Mortality Database period tables. Following <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018)</a>, our data covers only years in which a census was undertaken. Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018) explain: "census data are available every ten years starting in 1841 for England, and every ten years starting in 1860 for Sweden. For France they occurred every 5 years between 1836 and 1936 (except for 1871 which was held in 1872, and for 1916 which was cancelled) and then for 1946, 1962, 1968, 1975, 1982, 1990 and 1999."

  # Maternal deaths to 2030 (BAU vs. SDG Target) - based on World Bank & UN (2018)
  
  Maternal deaths were calculated by Our World in Data under two scenarios:
  - extrapolation of average annual progress (during the period 2005-2015) in maternal mortality rates through to 2030; this provides a 'business-as-usual' trajectory;
  - for countries who would not under a business-as-usual trajectory reach the UN SDG Target 3.1 of at least as low as 70 deaths per 100,000 live births, the required trajectory necessary to reach this target.
  
  Maternal deaths were derived from these two scenarios by multiplying the maternal mortality ratio (described below from the World Bank) by the annual number of births under the UN Population Division (2018) median fertility scenario from 2015 to 2030.
  
  The difference in maternal deaths between these two trajectories is here assumed to be the 'maternal lives at stake' from not reaching SDG Target 3.1. 
  
  Maternal mortality trajectories were calculated by Our World in Data based on a combination of business-as-usual extrapolations of historical trends published by the World Bank (2018).
  
  Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.
  
  The World Bank's source data is derived from: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2015.
  
  Our future figures, extending from 2015 to 2030 were estimated assuming a 'business-as-usual' continuation of average progress in the latest 10 years of maternal mortality data (2005-2015). Here we calculated the average annual change over this period, and applied it from 2015 onwards to derive estimates by 2030. 
  
  Note that these figures therefore do not represent a forecast or prediction, but simply represent expected change if progress continues at recent rates.
  
  The rates required to reach SDG Target 3.1 (70 per 100,000 live births) were quantified by calculating the average annual rate of decline necessary to reach 70 per 100,000 by 2030 from the 2015 value of a given country. This is shown only for countries who would not reach the SDG Target by 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory.

  Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared (m2). The WHO define a BMI <=18.5 as 'underweight'; 18.5 to <25 as 'normal/healthy'; 25.0 to <30 as 'overweight'; and >30.0 as 'obese'.
  
  The data was sourced from 2,416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 97.4 million participants aged 20 years and older.
  
  NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) is a network of health scientists around the world that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories. The group works closely with the World Health Organisation (WHO), through the WHO Collaborating Centre on NCD Surveillance and Epidemiology at Imperial College London. NCD-RisC pools high-quality population-based data using advanced statistical methods, designed specifically for analysing NCD risk factors. The Collaboration currently has data from over 2,000 population-based surveys from 189 countries since 1957, with nearly 25 million participants whose risk factor levels have been measured.

  # Measures and indicators for Poverty - PovcalNet (World Bank) (2017)
  
  Closing the poverty gap:
  
  The cost of closing the poverty gap does not take into account costs and inefficiencies from making the necessary transfers.
  
  The cost of closing the poverty gap is calculated as follows: Poverty Gap Index x Poverty Line (1.9 int-$ per day) x 365 x Population.
  
  The poverty gap index for each country corresponds to the estimates available via the option 'Replicate the World Bank's regional aggregation' available in the PovcalNet on-line tool.
  
  The unit of measure is international-$ (2011 PPP), in order to allow cross-country comparisons. This should not be confused with market dollars. 
  
  The poverty gap index estimates from the World Bank's PovcalNet data cover low and middle income countries, with observations every three years in the period 1981-2013. To achieve this level of granularity, the World Bank relies on interpolation for countries in which survey data are not available in particular years, but are available either before or after (or both). The process of interpolation requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the missing year. You can read more about this process in http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/methodology.aspx.
  
  ---
  
  Poverty and income groups in non-rich countries:
  
  PovcalNet allows to calculate different poverty lines using 2011 PPPs for several reference years (1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013).
  
  OWID team calculated different poverty lines to define the consumption groups. For example, consumption group 1.25 - 1.9 is calculated as follows: 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.9 int-$ per day' minus 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.25 int-$ per day'.
  Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.
  
  Warning:
  'Rich' countries are not included in the PovcalNet tables used for these calculations. Therefore, people belonging to these consumption groups, but living in rich countries (defined by the World Bank) are not represented in these figures.
  
  'Non-rich' countries are all countries in the World except: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.

  World population in absolute poverty:
  
  The share of World population living in Absolute poverty corresponds to the poverty headcount at the World Bank poverty line of 1.9$ per day.
  
  Data between 1981 and 2013 are from 'World Total' in PovcalNet's "Regional aggregation using 2011 PPP and $1.9/day poverty line".
  
  The 2030 projection of 4.2% is taken from Ferreira at al. (World Bank, 2015), p.37. This projection is "based on the country-specific historic average growth rates for the past 10 years". According to the report, an alternative projection based on the last 20 years would give 5.7%.
  
  ---
  
  Share living in extreme poverty by region:
  
  The share of population living in extreme poverty by world region is calculated dividing the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty by the population living in the region.
  
  To calculate the share of population living in extreme poverty at world level OWID team uses the total world population, not the sum of the 6 regions. In fact, as explained below, the six world regions do not take into account high-income countries.
  PovcalNet provides regional aggregation using 2011 PPPs and $1.90/day poverty line for reference years 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
  Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed. Therefore, OWID team calculated the number of the missing variable subtracting the sum of the observed regions from the World Total. For example, dis-aggregated data is not available for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2013:
  
  MENA 2013 = World Total - (East Asia and Pacific + Europe and Central Asia + Latin America and the Caribbean + South Asia + Sub-Saharan Africa).
  
  Warning:
  The most recent figures from the MENA reason do not necessarily reflect the geopolitical turmoil in the region.
  
  High-income countries are not included in PovcalNet tables used for this calculations.

  # Meat consumption in EU28 (OECD, 2018)
  
  Per capita meat availability, given as the average of the EU-28 countries. Meat availability is typically taken as an estimate of per capita consumption. Meat availability does not account for consumption (household and retail waste), so actual consumption will be slightly lower than these values.
  
  Per capita meat consumption is measured in kilograms per person per year.

  # Mental health prevalence (IHME)
  
  Mental health data is based on the IHME, GBD 'prevalence' data. The IHME denotes prevalence as: "The total number of cases of a given disease in a specified population at a designated time. It is differentiated from INCIDENCE, which refers to the number of new cases in the population at a given time."
  
  The variable 'depressive disorders' refers to the sum of those suffering from 'major depressive disorder' and 'persistent depressive disorder'.
  
  'Eating disorders' is the sum of those suffering from 'anorexia nervosa' and 'bulimia nervosa'.
  
  GBD define drug and alcohol use disorders by:
  "Drug dependence is defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) as the presence of three or more indicators of dependence for at least a month within the previous year. These indicators consist of a strong desire to take the substance, impaired control over use, a withdrawal syndrome on ceasing or reducing use, tolerance to the effects of the drug, the need for larger doses to achieve the desired psychological effect, a disproportionate amount of time spent by the user obtaining, using, and recovering from drug use, and persistence of drug taking despite the problems that occur.

  # Mental health services across incomes - Wang et al. (2007)
  
  Data is available only for a small number of countries, and based on household surveys over the period 2001-2004.
  
  'Share receiving any treatment for mental health' refers to the percentage of total respondents (with or without mental health burden) who received any form of treatment in the last 12 months.
  
  In differentiating the share of people with particular severities of mental illness receiving treatment, the authors define the following categories:
  - 'Severe' = "bipolar I disorder or substance dependence with a physiological dependence syndrome, making a suicide attempt in conjunction with any other disorder, reporting severe role impairment due to a mental disorder in at least two areas of functioning measured by disorder-specific Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS),12 or having overall functional impairment from any disorder consistent with a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)13 score of 50 or less."
  
  - 'Moderate' = "substance dependence without a physiological dependence syndrome or at least moderate interference in any SDS domain"
  
  - 'Mild' = all other disorders not noted above.
  
  Mental health services were classified into the following sectors: 
  - mental health specialty (psychiatrist, psychologist, other mental health professional in any setting, social worker or counsellor in a mental health specialty setting, use of a mental health hotline); 
  - general medical (primary care doctor, other general medical doctor, nurse, any other health professional not previously mentioned); 
  - human services (religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, or counsellor in any setting other than a specialty mental health setting);
  - complementary and alternative medicine (any other type of healer such as chiropractors, participation in an internet support group, participation in a self-help group).

  Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.

  # Milestones of Women's Political Representation - Paxton et al (2006)
  
  Data description:
  Paxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1893-2003. OWID updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources). 
  Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various other sources. IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below. Moreover, data extension to 2017 means that our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003.
  
  Data construction:
  Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year. Therefore, we have constructed this dataset which indicates the status of sovereign countries using the values "Yes" and "No". More specifically, if the year of universal suffrage is less than 1990 for the United States, we coded ‘Universal suffrage to women’ in the United States in 1990 as Yes. Note that the United States had gained sovereignty by then. 
  In addition, our dataset doesn’t consider these milestones as ordered achievements in women’s political representation. Paxton et al (2006) assumed that a country can only elect a woman MP once the universal suffrage has been granted. However, there are countries whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage. Therefore, we calculate values for each milestone independently and map countries as per the original source definition of sovereign.
  
  Additional data sources: 
  This section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.
  
  Year of sovereignty 
  CIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran.

  Share of women in parliament 
  IPU’s Statistical Archive (http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm) for all countries from 2004 to 2017. For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament. This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995. They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments. Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year. If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.
  Handling data issues: 
  For years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament. For most countries, the values match exactly. However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match. As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003. Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps. For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.

  # Military Personnel - COW (2017)
  
  Notes and definitions as provided by the source.
  
  1. Military personnel estimates include active, regular military units of the land, naval, and air components. Troops in the reserves such as those found in the United States were not included in the state’s annual total. Colonial troops (such as Indian troops under British command during India’s colonial period) were usually not included in this total if they were a separately administered force.
  
  2. The military personnel data exclude the military forces of foreign military forces, semi-autonomous states and protectorates, and insurgent troops. Such units were not part of a regular national armed force under a military chain of command. Their inclusion would distort the number of personnel that could be summoned when deemed necessary.
  
  3. Figures reflect the project's best judgement on which forces were intended for combat with foreign parties. Irregular forces such as civil defense units, frontier guards, gendarmerie, carabineri, and other quasi-military units were nominally responsible for defending outlying districts or for internal security and could be mobilized in time of war. We usually excluded them, however, because they were not integral to the regular armed forces (e.g. Cossack troops of nineteenth century Russia). When these forces were the only military a nation had they were still excluded (e.g. Costa Rica and Switzerland).
  
  4. Armed forces in several semi-feudal nations, including the warlord armies in pre-modern Japan and China, and Jannissary troops in the Ottoman Empire: We counted only those forces that were acting at the behest of the central government. For example, we included only the Imperial troops and those armies of feudal lords operating on the behalf of the throne in the case of pre-modern Japan.
  
  5. National police forces organized for both foreign and domestic purposes and found in several developing nations in the twentieth century: Such units come directly under the military chain of command and are fully a part of the armed forces at the immediate disposal of a national government. Examples include the old National Guard of Nicaragua and the national police forces of many African states. When such forces provided dual functions of foreign combat and internal security, we included them in its military personnel figures; otherwise, they were excluded

  # Military expenditure as a share of GDP - OWID based on COW & SIPRI (2017)
  
  The National Material Capabilities dataset, from the Correlates of War (COW) Project, contains long-run estimates of the military power of countries.
  
  The COW data series on military expenditure ends in 2012 and it is measured in current currency units; specifically British Pounds up to the year 1914, and US Dollars thereafter. This reflects the fact that the COW data was originally intended for cross-country comparisons at specific points in time, rather than for tracking changes in military expenditure over the long-run.
  
  Considering this, at Our World in Data we have produced a new dataset, based on the COW data, which does allow for comparisons both across countries and time. Here is a description of what we have done. 
  <ol>
    <li>We first took the COW dataset and used historical exchange rates from the Bank of England to unify the entire series into a single currency (nominal British Pounds).</li>
    <li>Then we converted this series into shares of GDP. For this we used historical cross-country estimates of nominal GDP, also available in British Pounds from the CEPII research centre.</li>
    <li>Finally, we extended the series forward up until 2016 by appending data from SIPRI, as published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?page" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</li></ol>
  Please note that we use exchange rates from the Bank of England because the original exchange rates used to produce the COW estimates are not available. While we are aware that this introduces noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in any systematic way. It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates already had.
  
  Also note that the entity 'World' shows values from SIPRI for the period 1960-2016.

  # Military expenditure, constant 2015 US$ - SIPRI (2017)
  
  To calculate military expenditure per capita, the SIPRI military expenditure series (in constant 2015 USD) was divided by the total population of each country (sourced from COW's National Military Capabilities database). 
  
  Russia's time series includes three observations from the USSR data series for the years 1988,1898, and 1990.
  
  Limitations and exceptions: Data on military expenditures are not compiled using standard definitions and are often incomplete and unreliable due to countries' reluctance to disclose military information. Even in countries where the parliament vigilantly reviews budgets and spending, military expenditures and arms transfers rarely receive close scrutiny or full, public disclosure (see Ball 1984 and Happe and Wakeman-Linn 1994). However, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has adopted a definition of military expenditure derived from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) former definition (in use until 2002; see Definitions).
  
  In the many cases where SIPRI cannot make independent estimates, it uses the national data provided. Because of the differences in definitions and the difficulty in verifying the accuracy and completeness of data, data on military expenditures are not always comparable across countries. However, SIPRI puts a high priority on ensuring that the data series for each country is comparable over time.
  
  General comments: Data for some countries are based on partial or uncertain data or rough estimates.
  
  Statistical concept and methodology: SIPRI military expenditure data includes military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions and social services for military personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, and weapons conversion and destruction. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require more detailed information than is available about military budgets and off-budget military expenditures (for example, whether military budgets cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, and military pensions).
  
  SIPRI data for the most recent years include two types of estimate which apply to all countries: (a) figures for the most recent years are for adopted budgets, budget estimates or revised estimates, and are revised, more often than not, in subsequent years; and (b) the deflator used for the latest year in the series is an estimate SIPRI's primary source of military expenditure data is official data provided by national governments. These data are derived from budget documents, defense white papers, and other public documents from official government agencies, including government responses to questionnaires sent by SIPRI, the UNODA, or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Secondary sources include international statistics, such as those of NATO and the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Other secondary sources include country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit, country reports by IMF staff, and specialist journals and newspapers.
  
  The data on military expenditures as a share of GDP are SIPRI estimates. The SIPRI military expenditure figures are presented on a calendar-year basis. The only exception is the USA, for which statistics report data on a fiscal-year basis. Calendar-year data are calculated on the assumption of an even rate of expenditure throughout the fiscal year. The ratio of military expenditure to GDP is calculated in domestic currency at current prices and for calendar years.

  # Mismanaged plastic waste by region - OWID based on Jambeck et al. (2015)
  
  Jambeck et al. quantified municipal and plastic waste streams from coastal populations in 2010 with projections to the year 2025.
  
  The authors' definition of a coastal population is based on those who live within 50km of a coastal water. Such populations are those for which plastic waste is at risk of leading to ocean debris. Sources further inland are significantly less likely to end up as ocean debris.
  
  The authors define mismanaged and inadequately managed waste as follows: "mismanaged waste is material that is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Mismanaged waste could eventually enter the ocean via inland waterways, wastewater outflows, and transport by wind or tides."
  
  National data has been aggregated by region by Our World in Data. We have aggregated national totals based on World Bank regional definitions.

  # Missing plastic budget (Lebreton et al. 2019)
  
  Data describes modelled and projected ocean plastic under three 'plastic emissions' scenarios.
  
  Given is the modelled global accumulation of buoyant macroplastics (>0.5 cm) in the ocean. And the accumulation of microplastics (<0.5 cm), which is degraded plastic material from the ocean surface layer.
  
  This is given under three scenarios:
  (1) Emissions of plastic to the world's oceans stopped by 2020;
  (2) Emissions stagnated at 2020 levels;
  (3) Increasing emissions of plastic until 2050 in line with the average growth rate of global plastic production from 2005-2015.

  Missing women are defined as the number of additional women who would be alive in the absence of sex discrimination. Missing women are the sum of women missing at birth (as a result of sex-selective abortion) and excess female mortality through infanticide or neglect.
  
  Missing female births and excess female mortality are calculated based on the difference between observed and expected sex ratios.
  
  Authors have calculated this historically from 1970 to today in five-year intervals, with projections through to 2100.

  GSMA's definition of mobile money services:
  - A mobile money service includes transferring money and making payments using the mobile phone.
  
  - The service must be available to the unbanked, e.g. people who do not have access to a formal account at a financial institution.
  
  - The service must offer a network of physical transactional points which can include agents, outside of bank branches and ATMs, that make the service widely accessible to everyone.
  
  - Mobile banking or payment services (such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet) that offer the mobile phone as just another channel to access a traditional banking product are not included.
  
  Data refers to the cumulative number of customer accounts at the end the year indicated. Customers who have not been registered but perform transactions over the counter are NOT included.
  
  Global data are is available from 2006-2018. Regional data are not available before 2012, due to confidentiality restriction with the survey participants. However, 2006 data for Sub-Saharan Africa are available as published in GSMA, The State of Mobile Money in Sub-Saharan Africa 2016.

  # Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) - Gershuny and Fisher (2013)
  
  The Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) compiles a cross-nationally harmonised set of time use surveys where recorded variables have been comparably recoded. Activities are sorted into 24 categories for the population aged between 21-65. We restrict our sample to working-age adults to minimise the role of time allocation decisions with a strong inter-temporal component following <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55560/1/508634636.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aguiar and Hurst (2006)</a>. 
  
  The following methodology was used to arrive at the minutes spent across the 24 recorded activities:
  <ul>
  <li>Using the MTUS simple dataset, the sample was restricted to individuals aged between 21-65.</li>
  <li>The minutes spent on each activity were weighted by the ‘propwt’ variable which brings the sample in line with the population from which it was drawn and ensures only good quality diaries are used. More information on the construction of ‘propwt’ can be found here: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/chapter-5-weights-in-mtus.pdf </li>
  <li>To calculate the mean number of minutes spent on an activity in a country in a given year, we took an average of the number of minutes spent on each of the 24 activities reported by the diarists. All diary entries where no minutes are recorded for a certain activity are treated as missing and are not included in the calculated average. <a href="https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf" rel="noopener" target"_blank">Gershuny and Fisher (2016)</a> mention "it is impossible to say for certain if [entries of zero minutes] is because the diarist did not do the activity or if the diarist actually did undertake the activity but did not report it in the diary". Therefore, estimates should be interpreted as an upper bound for the average number of minutes spent on an activity by those diarists who have reported taking part in an activity.</li>
  <li>The data is normalised to 1440 minutes per day. In other words, countries for which time use does not sum to 1440 minutes after weighting and averaging, the missing minutes are equally distributed across all activities. </li>
  </ul>
  
  Please see Table 1.1 for a list of all the surveys and years included and Table 1.2 for technical information on each time use survey: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf

  # Non-communicable disease age-standardized death rates - IHME (2017)
  
  The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the age-standardized death rates by cause and risk factors for any given year.
  
  It is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: "the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury." Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.
  
  Data here relates to the age-standardized death rates from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - that is, the cause of death rather than particular risk factors which may increase the likelihood of NCDs. Age-standardized death rates correct for differences in population size by reporting the number of deaths per 100,000 people, and the age of the population by assuming a constant age distribution in line with a reference population.

  Electricity is not included because of the difficulty of separating consumption between heating and other services - its inclusion would only increase the decline in solid fuels.

  # North Atlantic Hurricanes (HUDRAT, NOAA)
  
  Data on the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, in addition to the number that made landfall in the United States, as published in the HURDAT (Hurricane Database) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
  
  This data runs from 1851 through to the latest annual data.
  
  Hurricanes are categorised by the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) which classifies by five categories (1 being the lowest; 5 the highest) based on the intensity of sustained winds. This scale estimates potential property damage. 
  
  Major hurricanes are defined as those with a 3, 4 or 5 rating on the SSHWS; these are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage.
  
  The NOAA notes that because of the sparseness of towns and cities before 1900 in some coastal locations along the United States, the data prior to 1900 may not be complete for all states.
  
  "ACE" is an abbreviation for "Accumulated Cyclone Energy". ACE is an index that combines the numbers of systems, how long they existed and how intense they became. It is calculated by squaring the maximum sustained surface wind in the system every six hours that the cyclone is a Named Storm and summing it up for the season.
  
  The Power Dissipation Index (PDI) accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency. he lines have been smoothed using a five-year weighted average, plotted at the middle year. The most recent average (2011–2015) is plotted at 2013.

  Data was assessed by Our World in Data based on UN documentation of its Urbanization Prospects (2018). The Urbanization Prospects presents data on the number and share of the population residing in urban areas for each country from 1950 with projections to 2050.
  
  There is no consistent definition of what constitutes an 'urban area'. This is highly variable across countries. This data presents the number of countries with a given minimum threshold of inhabitants needed for it to be defined an 'urban area'. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.
  
  Note that some countries with minimum inhabitant thresholds noted here also include additional qualities (such as population density) to be met.

  # Number of people requiring treatment for neglected tropical diseases - WHO
  
  This variable is defined as: "Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
  targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO."
  
  The UN notes: "This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of
  the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention – that is, treatment and care for NTDs."

  # Number of people who are undernourished - FAO SOFI (2018) & World Bank (2017)
  
  The number of people who are undernourished was derived by combining several datasets: data prior to 2005 was derived using the prevalence of undernourishment (%) from World Bank, World Development Indicators and the UN FAO State of Food Insecurity 2017; and global population figures utilised by the UN FAO database. Multiplying these figures allow for the calculation of the absolute number of people undernourished.
  
  Data from 2005 onwards is taken from the UN SOFI (2018) report.
  
  The number of people with sufficient caloric intake (i.e. not undernourished) was calculated as the difference between total population and number of people undernourished.

  # Numbers and Shares of Each Political Regime — V-Dem (2019)
  
  For each year 1900–2018, the V-Dem Project (v9, 2019), variable "Regimes of the world – the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)", classifies each country as one of four possible regimes:
  
  0. Closed autocracy
  1. Electoral autocracy
  2. Electoral democracy
  3. Liberal democracy
  
  The V-Dem Project makes these classifications based on a number of other measures. For details, see p. 254 of their "V-Dem Cookbook v9".
  
  The dataset "Numbers and Shares of Each Political Regime — V-Dem (2019)" was produced entirely from the above classification and contains 13 variables. These variables simply count, for each year 1900–2018, the number and share of each of the four regimes and combinations thereof.

  Scholarships are defined as: "Financial aid awards for individual students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs. Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country."

  # OPHI Multidimensional Poverty Index - Alkire and Robles (2016)
  
  Definitions
  
  People are considered 'multidimensional poor' if they are deprived in at least one third of the weighted indicators.
  
  The ten indicators relate to: Years of Schooling, Child School Attendance, Child Mortality, Nutrition, Electricity, Sanitation, Drinking Water, Floor, Cooking Fuel, Asset Ownership. The first four of these indicators carry a weight of one sixth each (i.e. 0.166). The other six have a weight of one eighteenth each (i.e. 0.055)
  
  Survey data
  
  Years correspond to the year reported for the underlying survey used as source in each country. Whenever surveys correspond to year intervals (e.g. 2011-2012), we display the end year for that interval.
  
  The source notes that "The global MPI was first released in 2010, for 104 developing countries, and has been updated yearly with the latest data available. Starting from winter 2014/2015, updates are now made twice a year, in summer and winter. In June 2015, the Global MPI was updated for 32 countries and 6 new countries have been added to the list of those last reported in 2014. In total it now covers 101 developing countries, using data ranging from 2005 to 2014."

  # Oil reserves - BP Statistical Review (2016)
  
  The definition of 'proven reserves' is taken to be the following: "Generally taken to be those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The data series for total proved oil does not necessarily meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, nor does it necessarily represent BP’s view of proved reserves by country."
  
  The estimates in this table have been compiled using a combination of primary official sources, third-party data from the OPEC Secretariat, World Oil, Oil & Gas Journal and independent estimates of Russian reserves based on official data and Chinese reserves based on information in the public domain. Canadian oil sands 'under active development' are an official estimate. Venezuelan Orinoco Belt reserves are based on the OPEC Secretariat and government announcements.
  
  Reserves include gas condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) as well as crude oil.

  Figures represent stratospheric ozone, and effective stratospheric chlorine (ESC) based on historical measurement and future projections from chemistry-climate models.
  
  Chemistry-climate models are used to make projections of total ozone amounts that account for the effects of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and climate change. Regional and global projections are shown for total ozone and ESC for the period
  1960–2100, referenced to 1960 values (i.e. 1960 = 0).
  
  Data is based on those in Q20-2 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer: 2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.

  # Ozone concentration-StateofGlobalAir
  
  Data is gathered based on a combination of air quality observations from satellites combined with information from global chemical transport models, and available ground measurements. A global chemical transport model was used to calculate a seasonal (summer, when temperatures are highest) average concentration. Variation in the timing of the ozone (summer) season in different parts of the world is accounted for in these datasets. Global exposure to PM2.5 is then systematically estimated based on blocks or grid cells covering 0.1° x 0.1° of longitude and latitude (approximately 11 km x 11 km at the equator).
  
  Taking into account the population in each block within a country, this data is then aggregated as estimated exposure concentrations to national-level population-weighted averages for a given year.

  # Ozone depletion impacts on skin cancer incidence - Slaper et al.
  
  The authors modelled the number of excess skin cancer cases they would expect among fair-skinned populations in the United States and Northwest Europe as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion.
  
  This was modelled for a scenario of no restrictions on ozone-depleting substances, where the authors assumed a 3% annual increase in emissions of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), halons and methyl chloroforms. 
  
  The Montreal Protocol scenario assumed a decline of five important ozone-depleting substances by 50% by the end of 1999 as agreed in the protocol in 1987.
  
  The Copenhagen Amendment assumed the production of 21 ozone-depleting substances reduced to zero by the end of 1995.

  Through The Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer governments committed themselves to protect the ozone layer and to co-operate with each other in scientific research to improve understanding of the atmospheric processes.
  
  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted by Governments in 1987 and has been modified five times so far. Its control provisions were strengthened through four adjustments to the Protocol adopted in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). The Protocol aims to reduce and eventually eliminate the emissions of man-made ozone depleting substances

  # Patent and publication rates  - OWID based on World Bank & UN
  
  Rates of patent application and scientific/technical publication were calculated by OurWorldinData based on a combination of World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI) and United Nations Population Prospects estimates.
  
  Rates were calculated per million people by dividing the absolute number of patent applications and scientific & technical journal articles (as published by the World Bank) by UN population estimates for any given year.
  
  The World Bank indicators were based on "patent applications, residents" which measures the number of patent applications from residents of a given country; "patent applications, nonresidents" which measures the number of patent applications for any given country from individuals outside of that country. Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A patent provides protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for a limited period, generally 20 years.
  
  "Scientific and technical journal articles" which measures the number of scientific and engineering articles published in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine, biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.

  # Peak Farmland Projection - Ausbuel et al. (2013)
  
  This dataset is based on global arable land use projections from Ausubel et al. (2013), and combines two sources.
  
  Data from 1961-2014 is based on estimated global arable land use from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) database, available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home [accessed 12th August 2017].
  
  Data projections for 2015-2060 is based on model predications from the paper by Ausubel et al. (2013). This work projects that over the period 2010-2060, global arable land will decrease by 0.2 percent per year as a result of slowing population growth and agricultural productivity factors. We have taken this estimation from 2015 onwards.

  # Per capita CO2 emissions (based on CDIAC; GCP; Gapminder & UN)
  
  Per capita carbon dioxide emissions were derived by Our World in Data based on four datasets:
  (1) Long historical estimates of annual carbon dioxide emissions from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC)
  (2) Production and consumption-based estimates of CO2 emissions from the Global Carbon Project
  (3) Long-run population estimates by country, sourced from Gapminder & UN Population estimates
  (4) Long-run global population estimates from the HYDE Database
  
  Per capita emissions (production-based) were calculated by diving total national CO₂ emissions per year by population estimates.
  
  CO2 data has been converted from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

  Per capita pathways were derived by Our World in Data based on 1.5C and 2C emission pathways from Climate Action Tracker (CAT) and UN population projections. 
  
  1.5C and 2C pathways represent the median future scenarios of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to limit warming. Dividing this total budget by global population figures provides a value of an equitable budget per person.

  # Percentage of Americans living alone, by age - IPUMS
  
  Samples of the decennial Census (1900-2000) and the 2016 ACS from IPUMS-USA has been used to construct variables on the percentage of Americans living alone, by age and sex. 
  
  We include only those people who are reported to be living in a one person household and who do not live in group quarters. 
  
  The IPUMS defines group quarters as "largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder."
  
  We have excluded those recorded to be living in institutions, other group quarters, and additional households under the 2000 definition.

  # Plastic Waste - Jambeck et al. (2015)
  
  Jambeck et al. quantified municipal and plastic waste streams from coastal populations in 2010 with projections to the year 2025.
  
  The authors' definition of a coastal population is based on those who live within 50km of a coastal water. Such populations are those for which plastic waste is at risk of leading to ocean debris. Sources further inland are significantly less likely to end up as ocean debris.
  
  The authors define mismanaged and inadequately managed waste as follows: "mismanaged waste is material that is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Mismanaged waste could eventually enter the ocean via inland waterways,
  wastewater outflows, and transport by wind or tides."
  
  In October 2019, per capita plastic waste figures for Trinidad and Tobago were updated from 3.6kg to 0.29kg per person per day. This change was the result of error in the original waste figures published by the World Bank, which have since been revised and amended.

  # Plastic bag substitute comparisons (Danish EPA, 2018)
  
  The Danish Environmental Protection Agency conducted full life-cycle analysis (LCA) of environmental impacts of a range of grocery bag types. LCAs measure the total environmental impacts (such as greenhouse gas emissions) of a product across their full value chain (including inputs needed for their production).
  
  This was quantified for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a comparison of 'all environmental indicators' which was a combined value for greenhouse gas emissions, ozone depletion, human toxicity (cancer effects), human toxicity (non-cancer effects), photochemical ozone formation, ionizing radiation, particulate matter, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial eutrophication, marine eutrophication, ecosystem toxicity, resource depletion (fossil), resource depletion (abiotic), and water resource depletion.
  
  Values are given relative to a standard LDPE (Low-density polyethylene) single-use plastic bag, with values indicating the number of reuses a given bag would need to result in an equal environment impact. For example, a value of 5 would indicate a bag would have to be reused 5 times in order to have as low an environmental impact as the LDPE bag.

  # Plastic discarded, recycled, incinerated - Geyer et al. (2017)
  
  Estimates of the proportion of plastic waste discarded, recycled and incinerated based on data in Geyer et al. (2017).
  
  Geyer et al. (2017) note an average linear rate of increase in recycling of 0.7% per year from 1990 onwards, and 0.7% per year for incineration from 1980 onwards. 
  
  Data for 1980-2015 is based on historical estimates. Data from 2016-2050 is based solely on extrapolation of consistent growth trends of 0.7% for recycling and incineration; it therefore represents business-as-usual growth but should not be interpreted as a direct projection.

  Jambeck et al. quantified municipal and plastic waste streams from coastal populations in 2010. Their estimates were therefore multiplied by coastal population numbers to derive national plastic waste at risk of entering oceans and waterways. Here we calculate the total plastic waste generation by instead multiplying by total population figures.

  # Political Regimes — V-Dem (2019)
  
  For each year 1900–2018, the V-Dem Project (v9, 2019), variable "Regimes of the world – the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)", classifies each country as one of four possible regimes:
  
  0. Closed autocracy
  1. Electoral autocracy
  2. Electoral democracy
  3. Liberal democracy
  
  The V-Dem Project makes these classifications based on a number of other measures. For details, see p. 254 of their "V-Dem Cookbook v9".
  
  The dataset "Political Regimes — V-Dem (2019)" simply reproduces this v2x_regime classification. (For how this dataset was produced, see: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eFZmRChBFmeAXLx0tQ965YOHlXe6WQH_.)
  
  ---
  
  Here follow some notes on several peculiar "countries" that appear on the V-Dem Project dataset.
  
  First, there are three separate Palestines, namely:
  
  - "Palestine/British Mandate"  (v2x_regime coding available for the years 1914–48): coded as 0 (closed autocracy) every year.
  - "Palestine/Gaza" (1948–66 and 2007–18): 0 every year.
  - "Palestine/West Bank" (1948–49 and 2003–18): 0 in 1948–49, 2008–12, and 2015–18; 1 in all other years.
  
  We at OWID have decided to drop Palestine/British Mandate for 1948.
  
  Second, there are Somalia and Somaliland:
  
  - Somaliland (1900–2018): Coded as 0 in 1900–2002; 1 in 2003–09 and 2013–18; and 2 in 2010–12.
  - Somalia (1900–2018): 1 in 1956–69 and 1980–83; 0 in all other years.
  
  Thus, in this dataset, "Somalia" excludes Somaliland.
  
  Third, there are Tanzania and Zanzibar:
  
  - Zanzibar (1905–2018): 0 in 1905–94 and 1 in 1995–2018 = 1. 
  - Tanzania (1915–2018): 0 in 1915–61, 1 in 1962–94, 2 in 1995–2000, 1 in 2001–07, 2 in 2008, 1 in 2009, 2 in 2010–15, 1 in 2016–17, 2 in 2018.
  
  Thus, in this dataset, "Tanzania" excludes Zanzibar.
  
  Fourth, for 1990 and before, "Yemen" refers to North Yemen. There are separate data for "South Yemen" for the years 1900–90.

  # Polity IV + Wimmer and Min - Our World In Data (2006)
  
  The original data provides information on each territory's colonial power. To be able to combine this with the numerical Polity2 metric I coded colonized countries as -20. If a country was coded as a colony in the Wimmer and Min data and had a value in the Polity 2 data set then I preferred the Polity 2 measure and this is shown in the final data set.

  # Population (Gapminder, HYDE (2016) & UN (2019))
  
  Population data by country is taken from Version 5 of Gapminder. This provides data by country from 1800 through to 2100. The Gapminder dataset is available online at http://www.gapminder.org/.
  
  The regional, and world, long-run population series was constructed by Our World in Data based on two key sources: the HYDE database (2016) and UN's World Population Prospects (2019). 
  
  - HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1940
  - UN World Population Population Prospects (2019) from 1950 to 2019; 
  - Projections to 2100 from the UN World Population Population Prospects (2019)
  
  HYDE regions have been aggregated to match with UN regional groupings:
  - 'Europe' and 'CIS' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Europe'
  - 'Asia' and 'Middle East' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Asia'
  
  HYDE Database, available at: https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/basicdrivingfactors/population/index-2.html
  
  From 1950 to 2019, country, region, and world estimates come from the UN Population Revision (2019), and projections to 2100 from the UN Population Revision (2019) medium variant scenario.

  # Population Density - HYDE and UN Population Division (2008 Revision)
  
  (1) Original HYDE data had millennial observations from 10,000BCE to 0CE; centennial observations from 0-1,700CE; decennial observations from 1700-1950CE; and yearly observations from 1,950-2,000CE. UN projections are also annual. The granularity of these data were reduced to observations (i) every 5,000 years from from 10,000BCE to 0CE; (ii) every 500 years from 0-1,950CE; and (iii) every 5 years thereafter. (2) Observations for Australia exclude Heard and McDonald Island. (3) Observations for the United Kingdom exclude the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. (4) The original HYDE data had a series for Serbia and Montenegro; this series was dropped and series for the two separate countries were kept (Kosovo included in Serbia).

  PovcalNet Version.
  All estimates use PovcalNet data from the update released 2017/10/10. This update includes several methodological changes with respect to previous versions. This includes an update of the underlying country-level data. You can find details here: http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/whatIsNew.aspx
  
  Methodology.
  PovcalNet allows calculating different poverty lines using 2011 PPPs for several reference years (1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013).
  We calculated different poverty lines to define the consumption groups. For example, consumption group 1.25 - 1.9 is calculated as follows: 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.9 int-$ per day' minus 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.25 int-$ per day'. 
  
  Underlying source data.
  Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.

  # Population fed by Haber-Bosch fertilizers - FAO (2017)
  
  
    Additional information: 
  Estimates of population sustained with and without the production of Haber-Bosch nitrogen are derived based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al. (2008) and its sources.
  World population figures were sourced from Gapminder for the years 1900-1949, and from the UN Population Division from 1950 onwards.
  The share of the world's population reliant on Haber-Bosch fertilizer production for food production was estimated based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al. (2008). These figures are based on approximation, although coincide with several published projections of these estimates. Erisman et al. estimate that by 2000, 44% of the global population were sustained by Haber-Bosch nitrogen, rising to 48% by 2008. This approximately coincides with Smil (2002) estimates of 40% by 2000. OWID have extrapolated these estimates to 2015, assuming that approximately 50% (±2%) rely on Haber-Bosch nitrogen.

  Postage rate refers to 1/2 ounces for 1863 and 1883. 1885 onward postage rates refer to 1 ounce letters. Two observations were reported for 1981, the average of the two observations is reported.
  
  The real postage rates were calculated:

  # Poverty Measures - World Bank (WDI) (2017)
  
  Definitions.
  
  This dataset has two different sets of variables concerning poverty: (i) Poverty Headcount Ratio and (ii) Poverty Gap. In turn, these are measured with respect to two different 'poverty lines': (a) 1.90$ a day and (b) 3.10$ a day. Poverty headcount ratio is a proxy for the 'quantity of poverty', while poverty gap represents the 'intensity of poverty'. A more detailed definition of these two variables is available here. (https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#key-definitions).
  
  Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption. 
  
  As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions. 
  
   
  
  Data and Methodology.
  
  According to the World Bank's definition: "PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows you to replicate the calculations made by the World Bank's researchers in estimating the extent of absolute poverty in the world".
  
  Data are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are from the Luxembourg Income Study database. For more information and methodology, please see PovcalNet. (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/methodology.aspx).
  
  PovcalNet data are updated annually. Details on how the new version differs from the previous one can be found here. (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/whatIsNew.aspx)

  # Poverty headcount (below $3.10 per day, 2011 PPP) - World Bank (WDI) (2016)
  
  The World Bank explains: "Poverty headcount ratio at $3.10 a day is the percentage of the population living on less than $3.10 a day at 2011 international prices. As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions. Note: five countries -- Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Lao PDR -- use the 2005 PPP conversion factors and corresponding $1.25 a day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in the rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic consumer price indexes. See Box 1.1 in the Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016 (http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report) for a detailed explanation."

  Data shows US precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. 
  
  This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from 1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated from total annual precipitation in inches. Anomalies for the contiguous 48 states and Alaska have been determined by calculating average precipitation anomalies for areas within each state based on station density and topography. These regional anomalies are then averaged together in proportion to their area to develop national results.

  # Prevalence of Undernourishment in Developing Countries - FAO (Food Security Indicators) (2017)
  
  The prevalence of undernourishment expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an active and healthy life. The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population.
  
  This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9.
  
  The indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1969-71 to 2014-16 to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.
  
  The FAO has maintained a constant definition of "developing countries" throughout the data series, with the following definition: "Includes all countries other than developed countries, namely: all countries in Africa except South Africa, all countries in Asia except Israel and Japan, all countries in Oceania except Australia and New Zealand, and all countries in North and Central America except Canada and USA, and all countries in South America."
  
  The aggregates are computed using a weighted population average.
  
  Earlier estimates for the prevalence of undernourishment in developing countries for 1970 and 1980. Over this period, methodological methods for the estimation of undernourishment have been refined for use in tracking progress on MDGs from 1990 onwards- this means earlier estimates have a higher level of uncertainty. Figures given here for 1970 and 1980 have been taken as the average between two FAO estimates from annual "State of Food Insecurity in the World" reports in 2006 and 2010 (referenced below). These estimates should therefore be utilised with caution, but have been included for longer-term perspective on reduction trends.

  # Prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency in children - WHO (2017)
  
  Data on vitamin-A deficiency is based on the reported prevalence of risk by the World Health Organization, which has collated national and household level survey data on indicators extending the period 1995-2005. Note that data on vitamin-A deficiency is typically not measured on an annual basis, therefore the year of measurement will vary by country, but lie within the period 1995-2005.
  
  All countries with a 2005 gross domestic product (GDP) ≥US$ 15 000 were assumed to be free from VAD of a public health significance and were therefore excluded. None of these 37 countries had retinol or night blindness data reported for either preschool-age children or pregnant women.
  
  Two sets of indicators of VAD are commonly used for population surveys: clinically assessed eye signs and biochemically determined concentrations of retinol in plasma or serum. The incidence of night blindness in individuals indicates moderate-to-severe systemic VAD. VAD can also be identified when serum retinol concentrations fall below below a cut-off value of 0.70 µmol/l.
  
  Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major nutritional concern in poor societies, especially in lower income countries. Its presence as a public health problem is assessed by measuring the prevalence of deficiency in a population, represented by specific biochemical and clinical indicators of status. The main underlying cause of VAD as a public health problem is a diet that is chronically insufficient in vitamin A that can lead to lower body stores and fail to meet physiologic needs (e.g. support tissue growth, normal metabolism, resistance to infection). Deficiency of sufficient duration or severity can lead to disorders that are common in vitamin A deficient populations such as xerophthalmia (xeros = dryness; -ophthalmia = pertaining to the eye), the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness, anaemia, and weakened host resistance to infection, which can increase the severity of infectious diseases and risk of death.

  # Prevalence of undernourishment since 2000 (FAOstats, 2018)
  
  Estimated prevalence and total number of undernourished individuals as reported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
  
  Data is based on its latest statistics on FAOstats (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS). This data extends from the year 2000 through to 2016 at national levels, and 2017 estimates by region and at the global level.
  
  Figures at the national level are reported as 3-year averages; here we have allocated these figures to the mid-year. For example, the UN FAO reports national data for "2014-2016" which we allocate to the year 2015.
  
  Some data, particularly for high-income countries, is not reported by the UN FAO. This is often the case for countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is less than 2.5% of the total population.
  
  The categories of Extreme Fragility and Fragile have been added as a variable based on the country groupings defined in the OECD's States of Fragility (2018) Report.

  There are three main types of nails: hand forged, machine cut, and wire. Blacksmiths produced hand forged nails until about 1820. Cut nails have been produced using a machine which cuts nails from sheets of iron or steel - technology patents for this machinery emerging in the late 18th century. Wire nails became more widely produced in the late 19th century with individual nails cut from a coil of drawn wire, one end sharpened at the tip, and the head of the nail added to the other (Sichel (2017)). 
  
  Real prices are calculated using Sichel’s (2017) consumer price index (CPI) dating back to 1695 constructed from the UK retail price index (RPI) from 1695-1784, and US CPI from 1784-2011. 2010 is used as the base year, so all prices adjusted for inflation are in terms of 2010 dollars. To calculate real price of nails in cents/lb, we use the following procedure:
  
  Real price of nails (cents/lb) = Nominal price of nails (cents/lb) divided by (CPI /100) 
  
  However, the real price of nails measured in units of cents per pound can obscure quality differences. To adjust for differences in quality, Sichel (2017) standardizes nail sizes, converting all nails to be as close as possible to a 2”, size 6d nail, to construct real prices in cents per nail. The counts of nails per pound used for each year can be found in Table 3 of Sichel’s (2017) working paper.
  
  In calculating the real price of nails (cents/nail), we first convert units from cents per pound to cents per nail, and then convert from nominal to real prices. 
  
  Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nail (cents/lb) x 1/[count of nails per pound]
  
  Real price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) divided by (CPI/100)
  
  The nominal price series for nails, from which the real series have been constructed, are comprised of multiple data sources. 
  
  From 1695 to 1792, prices are from Beveridge (1939) in the United Kingdom. Where data is not reported for selected years, the values for these years are interpolated. Prices have been converted from shillings to cents. 
  
  For the period 1784 to 1813 prices are sourced from Cole (1938) although the type of nails have not been specified and are thus assumed to be mixed (forged and cut) nails. 
  
  From 1814 to 1890 data covers machine-cut nail prices. Between 1814 and 1828, prices are taken from Cole (1938). Quotes for later years are from various sources with the data reproduced in ‘Historical Statistics of the United States’. 
  
  The period covering 1890 up until 2011 refers to wire nails. This section of the data series includes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
  For greater detail in the construction of this dataset, please see Sichel’s (2017)* working paper referenced below.

  Population data is based on the Medium UN projection (2017 Edition) from 2015-2100. 
  
  Our World in Data have derived the change in the projected under-5 population between the year 2015 to 2050 (here, denoted as '2050') and the change between 2050 to 2100 (here, denoted as '2100'). This was calculated simply through the subtraction of 2015 under-5 numbers from projected 2050 figures; and 2050 figures subtracted from 2100 projections.

  # Public expenditure on health %GDP – OWID based on WHO and historical estimates
  
  Definitions
  
  The definition used by the World Health Organization (WHO) stipulates: “Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds.”
  
  In some studies and reports, capital expenditure is not included as part of total expenditure (public or private). This is the case, for example, with OECD figures. However, in this dataset we take the WHO definition as a basis, and hence capital expenditures are included.
  
  Whether reporting agencies include capital expenditure as part of healthcare expenditure depends on the System of Health Accounts (SHA) that is in place. The OECD figures use the SHA 2011, which is the latest revision. The WHO figure use a previous version.
  
  While it is widely accepted that the SHA 2011 is superior to previous versions, many countries still use previous versions. This means there is a tradeoff between coverage across countries, and data quality. In the interest of coverage, we have chosen to rely on WHO definitions.
  
  Handling of underlying sources
  
  This dataset was constructed by combining four sources. These are Lindert (1994), OECD (1993), OECD.stat. and the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database (WHO GHED)
  
  These four sources were combined as follows.
  
  For the period 1995-2015 we report the figures as published in WHO GHED.
  For the period 1970-1994, we extended the recent figures (from WHO GHED) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD.stat.
  For the period 1960-1969, we continue extending backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1993)
  For the period 1880-1930, we report observations from Lindert (1994).
  To be precise, the process of extrapolation consisted in taking the earliest available observation from WHO GHED, and then successively extending the series backwards; first by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD.stat, for the period 1970-1994; and then using the year-by-year rate of change in OECD (1993), for the period 1960-1969. Here is an example:
  
  WHO_(year-1)= WHO_year x [OECD.stat_(year-1)]/[OECD.stat_(year)]
  
  Backward extrapolation was necessary because the levels in the estimates from WHO GHED, OECD.stat and OECD (1993) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. This is partly because OECD.stat data does not include capital expenditure.
  
  The implicit assumption in our constructed dataset, then, is that the estimates from these three series have different levels, but common trends. Empirically, the validity of this assumption is supported by the trends in the overlapping years.

  # Public expenditure on health in the long run - Lindert (1994), OECD, WHO
  
  Lindert acknowledges difficulties in reconstructing health expenditure data for such old period due to data availability and definitions, and admits that a degree of subjectivity if inevitable. A full discussion on these issue is in Lindert (1994), pp.7-8.
  
  He adopts a definition of Public expenditure on health based on OECD, Social Expenditure 1960-1990, (1985), where it is defined as: 'Expenditure on hospitals, clinics and medical, dental and para-medical practitioners, public health, medicaments, prostheses, medical equipment and applicance or other prescribed health-related products, and applied research and experimental development related to health and medical delivery systems' (p.75).
  
  According to Annex C of OECD (1985), further information are available "in the 'Instructions and Definitions' which accompany the Government Expenditure Questionnaire completed by Member governments, the response to which provides the basis of the government expenditure accounts included in OECD National Accounts".

  Results presented here are in response to the question: "Please indicate whether you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose each way of producing electricity" [results for nuclear electricity production].
  
  Four responses were accepted for this question: "strongly support"; "somewhat support"; "somewhat oppose"; and "strongly oppose". We have simplified these results to "support" and "oppose" by summing the former and latter two responses, respectively.

  # Rate of internationally observed elections - Hyde and Marinov (2012)
  
  Codebook notes:
  " The National Elections across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) dataset provides detailed information on all election events from 1945-2012. To be included, elections must be for a national executive figure, such as a president, or for a national legislative body, such as a parliament, legislature, constituent assembly, or other directly elected representative bodies. In order for an election to be included, voters must directly elect the person or persons appearing on the ballot to the national post in question.
  
  Elections may or may not be competitive, and may have any number of other ostensible flaws. In fact, the inclusion of flawed elections is a feature of the NELDA dataset. "
  
  The unit of observation is the NELDA dataset is the election round. The ElectionID variable has been used to collapse multi-round elections into one observation for OWID’s purposes. In three election events, Equatorial Guinea's 1993 legislative/parliamentary election, Equatorial Guinea's 1996 presidential/other direct executive election, and Zimbabwe's 2005 legislative/parliamentary election, these election events were coded as unobserved by Western monitors, yet criticized with allegations of significant vote-fraud. For our purposes, these three election events have been re-coded as unobserved and not criticized as no Western monitors were in the country at the time to monitor the election.
  
  The percent of observed and criticized elections was calculated as:
  
  % observed and criticized elections = (no.of criticized elections/ total no. of elections) * 100
  
  The percent of observed and not criticized elections was calculated as:
  
  % observed and not criticized elections = [(no. of observed elections - no. of criticized elections)/total number of elections] * 100
  
  Microstates, defined as those countries with less than 500,000 citizens at the time of election, have been excluded. Five independent states that did not hold any direct elections between 1945-2012 - China, Eritrea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates - have also been excluded.

  # Rate of internationally observed elections - Susan Hyde (2011)
  
  International election monitoring can be defined as the observation of an election by one or more independent parties, typically from another country or non-governmental organization (NGO). Election observers primarily assess the conduct of elections and factors influencing the prevailing electoral environment. As Hyde (2011) notes "nearly 80 percent of all national elections are now monitored". For further background information see Hyde's 2011 paper referenced above.
  
  The percent of observed and criticized elections was calculated as:
  
  % observed and criticized elections = (no.of criticized elections/ total no. of elections) * 100
  
  The percent of observed and not criticized elections was calculated as:
  
  % observed and not criticized elections = [(no. of observed elections - no. of criticized elections)/total number of elections] * 100
   
  Countries excluded from the analysis are microstates and the five independent states that did not hold any direct national elections between 1960 and 2006: China, Eritrea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

  # Religious Composition - Pew (2017)
  
  The original dataset reports the share of followers for some religions as "<1%" or ">99%". Because of technical limitations of the visualization tool, these values had to be changed to "1%" and "99%" respectively.
  
  In many countries, censuses and surveys do not provide information on religious subgroups such as Sunni and Shia Muslims or Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Christians. That is why Pew Research Center provides figures for religious group as a whole.
  
  For the purposes of the religious group projections, Pew categorizes the people who identify their religion as atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular as 'unaffiliated'. Data on subgroups of the unaffiliated is also unavailable in many countries. Therefore, separate estimates are not possible for atheists or agnostics.
  
  Pew does not include “cultural” or “ethnic” Jews (i.e. people who have Jewish ancestry but do not describe their present religion as Jewish) in the people who identify their religion as Jewish. A 2013 Pew Research survey found that more than one-in-five U.S. Jewish adults (22%) say they are atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular (categorized as 'unaffiliated'), but consider themselves Jewish aside from religion and have at least one Jewish parent. To avoid double-counting, these people are not included in the Jewish population.
  
  Finally, Pew Research Center points that within every major religious group, there is a spectrum of belief and practice. The projections are based on the number of people who self-identify with each religious group, regardless of their level of observance. What it means to be Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish or a member of any other faith may vary from person to person, country to country, and decade to decade.

  # Renewables Patents - IRENA (2016)
  
  Data reports the annual number of new patents filed under the category of each renewable technology.
  Annual number of patents by technology for the years 2014-2016 was calculated by OWID based on IRENA's cumulative number of patents for each technology in these years (i.e. annual number in 2014 = cumulative total in 2015 minus cumulative total in 2014).
  
  Note that figures for 2014-16 may be subject to a time lag; processing times of patent applications vary and some patents submitted over this period may not yet be recorded in statistics. These figures will be updated with time if additional patent applications are recorded.

  # Reported number and different estimations of polio cases (WHO, 2018)
  
  For the estimated number of polio cases using Tebbens et al.’s 2010 model:
  The WHO’s dataset of reported polio cases from 1980 onwards (the first link above) is used to produce an estimate of the actual number of polio cases. An explanation of the correction factor algorithm can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/ Part of the model input consists of the WHO’s surveillance system that can be found under the second link cited above. 
  
  
  For the estimated number of polio cases that disregard any reported cases after a country was certified polio-free and use Tebbens et al.’s (2010) model: 
  The WHO’s dataset from 1980 onwards (the first link above) was modified by deleting all documented polio cases after the year in which polio ceased to be endemic in each country (see map and data here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country). Then, Tebbens et al.’s  (2010) model is applied in the same way as for the “Estimated number of polio cases”, for which we provide an explanation here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/.

  # Required rate of maternal mortality decline for SDG - based on World Bank (2018)
  
  Data was calculated by Our World in Data based on 2015 estimates of maternal mortality published by the World Bank, and UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 3.1.
  
  The World Bank's World Development Indicators, available at: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/indicators. Data was downloaded on 30th August 2018.
  
  Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.
  
  The World Bank's source data is derived from: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2015.
  
  Here we calculate the average annual rate of decline required for each country to attain a maternal mortality ratio as low as 70 per 100,000 live births over the period 2015 to 2030. Data for countries with maternal mortality rates already below 70 per 100,000 (in 2015) are not included.
  
  Note that these figures therefore do not represent a forecast or prediction, but simply represent required rates of progress to attain a maternal mortality ratio as low as 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

  # Rotavirus deaths and cases in under-5s (IHME, 2018)
  
  Data is the summary of research published by Troeger et al. (2018) based on statistics from the IHME, Global Burden of Disease study.
  
  Data presents the estimated number of child (under five years old) deaths; child mortality rate; and number of cases from rotavirus. Also given is the estimated number of deaths averted from the rotavirus vaccine, and potential avertable deaths if full rotavirus vaccine coverage was achieved.
  
  Rotavirus is a diarrheal disease responsible for an estimated 29% of diarrheal disease deaths in children under five years old.
  
  Estimates of potentially avertable deaths from the rotavirus vaccine take into consideration its efficacy in different regions: whilst efficacy in children in high-income countries is typically greater than 90%, in lower-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, this efficacy rate is closer to 50%.

  # Rural & urban BMI - NCD RisC (2018)
  
  This dataset presents the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) in urban and rural areas for men and women by country, region, and globally.
  
  BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared (m²). The WHO define a BMI <=18.5 as 'underweight'; 18.5 to <25 as 'normal/healthy'; 25.0 to <30 as 'overweight'; and >30.0 as 'obese'.
  
  NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) is a network of health scientists around the world that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories. The group works closely with the World Health Organisation (WHO), through the WHO Collaborating Centre on NCD Surveillance and Epidemiology at Imperial College London. NCD-RisC pools high-quality population-based data using advanced statistical methods, designed specifically for analysing NCD risk factors. The Collaboration currently has data from over 2,000 population-based surveys from 189 countries since 1957, with nearly 25 million participants whose risk factor levels have been measured.

  # Share of landowners who are female - FAO (2017)
  
  Data on agricultural land ownership by gender is available and reported by the FAO across 102 countries. Currently this data is not available as a time-series, and is limited to measurement in a single census year. Note that this census year is not consistent across all countries. Data for most European and North American countries is based on 2010-11 datasets, whereas other countries can extend from 1993-2011. For graphing consistency, this has been shown as a single year (e.g. assuming these figures are representative of 2011). The actual years of measurement for each country can be found in the referenced FAO report and database.
  
  The FAO's publication on its Gender and Land Rights Database notes the following definition:
  "The agricultural landowner is defined as the legal owner of the agricultural land; however, definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. The indicator may not necessarily reflect documented ownership certified by a legal document. Especially in places where much of the land is not formally titled or documented, surveys often simply ask whether someone in the household owns the land, and if so, who owns it. In addition to officially titled ownership, it may also include proxies, such as the right to use, sell or bequeath the land, or the right to use it as collateral. This enables the indicator to capture different aspects of the “bundle of rights” related to land, rather than land ownership in the strictest sense of the term. The current indicator in the GLRD uses different definitions of ownership; they are specified for each country in the data notes. As data for more countries become available, it will be useful to calculate these measures using more than one definition of ownership.
  
  An individual is defined as a landowner whether they own land solely (they are the only owner of a plot of land) or jointly with someone inside or outside the household. Thus, households may have multiple landowners. In addition, households may own multiple plots of land with different owners identified for each plot."

  As explained by their Guidance for Data: "the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program (PEP) releases several different data series over the course of each decade". 
  
  Total U.S. population figures for the period 2007-2010 are taken from the 'Intercensal Estimates 2000-2010'. Each decade, PEP releases these 'Intercensal Estimates' which constitutes the preferred data series for the decade.  
  
  Total U.S. population figures for the period 2011-2016 are taken from the 'National Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016'. These estimates "are produced using a similar procedure to that used for our current postcensal estimates series, and with no knowledge of the Census count at the end of the decade."

  # Share of people who are worried about losing their job - World Values Survey (2014)
  
  Share of people who say they worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' in answer to the question "To what degree are you worried about the following situations? Losing my job or not finding a job". Possible answers include 'Very much', 'A great deal', 'Not much', 'Not at all', and 'No answer'. Our estimates exclude those with no answer given. 
  
  The methodology followed for constructing the variable is as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Created a dichotomous worry preference variable, combining responses of people who say they worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' and those who answered 'Not much' or 'Not at all', where 1=worry and 0=do not worry</li>
  <li>Generated a variable for the number of respondents in each country, by survey year </li>
  <li>Summed to give the total number of people who worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' with the above question and the total number of surveyed responses, for each country in each year </li>
  <li>Calculated the % of respondents who worry about losing or finding a job = (number of people who worry very much or a great deal / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
  </ul>
  
  The number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year. Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution. WVS data to this question is only available for the latest wave. Surveys have been conducted across countries in different years. See the WVS documentation for further information for the year in which Wave 6 of the WVS was carried out.

  # Share of population with access to electricity - World Bank
  
  Development Relevance: Maintaining reliable and secure electricity services while seeking to rapidly decarbonize power systems is a key challenge for countries throughout the world. More and more countries are becoming increasing dependent on reliable and secure electricity supplies to underpin economic growth and community prosperity. This reliance is set to grow as more efficient and less carbon intensive forms of power are developed and deployed to help decarbonize economies. Energy is necessary for creating the conditions for economic growth. It is impossible to operate a factory, run a shop, grow crops or deliver goods to consumers without using some form of energy. Access to electricity is particularly crucial to human development as electricity is, in practice, indispensable for certain basic activities, such as lighting, refrigeration and the running of household appliances, and cannot easily be replaced by other forms of energy. Individuals' access to electricity is one of the most clear and un-distorted indication of a country's energy poverty status. Electricity access is increasingly at the forefront of governments' preoccupations, especially in the developing countries. As a consequence, a lot of rural electrification programs and national electrification agencies have been created in these countries to monitor more accurately the needs and the status of rural development and electrification. Use of energy is important in improving people's standard of living. But electricity generation also can damage the environment. Whether such damage occurs depends largely on how electricity is generated. For example, burning coal releases twice as much carbon dioxide - a major contributor to global warming - as does burning an equivalent amount of natural gas.
  
  Long Definition: Access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity. Electrification data are collected from industry, national surveys and international sources.
  
  Periodicity: Annual
  
  Statistical Concept and Methodology: Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources: mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as "Estimate"). Notation "Assumption" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations.

  # Share of pregnancies end in abortion - Sedgh et al. (2016)
  
  Estimated share of pregnancies that end in abortion. This data was derived by the authors using estimates of the incidence of abortions, and pregnancy rates at global, regional and sub-regional levels over the period 1990-2014. 
  
  The total number of pregnancies is the sum of all livebirths, abortions, and miscarriages (spontaneous fetal losses at 5 or more weeks of gestation). 
  
  The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, abortion incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.

  In the series for China, the original data shows a large temporary shift over the period 1997-2002. We have contacted the source for clarification, but in the meantime we have suppressed these observations from our data, since we have reasons to believe the shift is a mistake in the source. The deleted observations are: (1997, 40.95%; 1998, 44.13%; 1999, 44.09%; 2000, 41.42%; 2001, 43.20%; 2002, 41.26%).

  # Share of single parent families (UN Population Division 2018)
  
  The variable for the share of single parent families is taken from the <a href="https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/840">United Nations Database on Household Size and Composition (2018)</a>. 
  
  The UN database pulls from 4 different sources: 
  1) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); 
  2) the Demographic Yearbook (DYB) of the United Nations; 
  3) IPUMS-International;
  4) Labor Force Surveys (LFS) of the European Union, Eurostat. 
  
  Where a country time series was composed of multiple sources, we favoured the source covering the most years. In cases where there was a tie between sources, we favoured the DYB, then IPUMS, DHS, and lastly LFS estimates. The DYB covered the largest number of countries and the LFS the least.  
  
  Where multiple country-year observations came from the same source, we favoured the observation with the reference date occurring later in the year. This is true for Senegal in 2013 and Tanzania in 2004.
  
  The source for each observation can be found in the metadata spreadsheet <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/un-single-parent-final-metadata-stan.csv">here</a>.

  # Share of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion - Bearak et al. (2018)
  
  Estimated share of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion was derived by the authors based on global, regional and sub-regional estimates of unintended pregnancy rates and abortion incidence over the period 1990-2014. This is measured as the percentage of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion amongst women of reproductive age (15-44 years old). 
  
  The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.
  
  To estimate the unintended pregnancy rate, the authors "used a Bayesian hierarchical time series model in which the dependent variable was the number of unintended pregnancies among all women of reproductive age in a given country and year. The predictors were the numbers of women of reproductive age in each of the three subgroups of women (married women with an unmet need, married women experiencing failure with a contraceptive method, and all unmarried women)." This is measured as the number of unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-44 years old).
  
  Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.

  # Shark attacks and fatalities - Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) (2018) 
  
  The Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) keeps an incident log that is updated with each new shark attack. Four types of shark attack categories are included: provoked, unprovoked, boating incidents, and sea disasters. The GSAF defines provoked incidents as incidents in which "the shark was speared, hooked, captured or in which a human drew 'first blood'" versus unprovoked incidents where this behaviour did not occur. Boating incidents are defined as cases where "a boat was bitten or rammed by a shark." Sea disasters are "accidents that place people in the day-to-day business of sharks." 
  
  Shark attacks classified as "Invalid" or "Questionable" have been excluded from estimates.
  
  The link above provides more details about the type, area, location, activity, whether the victim was a male or female, their age, description of the injury, time of the incident, shark species, and investigator/source for each observation. 
  
  Where a range of dates is provided for a particular incident, we have used the earliest year when plotting the data. For example, where the date is provided as "Between 1918 and 1939" we plot this as 1918. For years entered as "Before xxxx", we have simply input the previous year. The observations 'Portugal / India' for 1580, and 'Africa' for 1846 have been dropped due to their geographical inaccuracy.
  
  The 'Global Shark Attack File'  figures reflect reported/recorded attacks or deaths only. For less recent years, these records could be incomplete.

  The Significant Earthquake Database is a global listing of over 5,700 earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present. A significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.
  
  Our World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake numbers by country/location per year. 
  
  Due to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record.

  # Social Expenditure in the long run - Lindert 2004; OECD 1985; OECD (SOCX).
  
  Definitions
  
  Social spending includes, among others, the following areas: health, old age, incapacity-related benefits, family, active labor market programmes, unemployment, and housing. In some studies and reports, education is included in social spending. This is not the case in this dataset.
  
  Handling of underlying sources
  
  This dataset was constructed by combining three sources. These are the OECD Social Expenditure Database (OECD SOCX), OECD (1985) and Lindert (2004).
  
  These three sources were combined as follows. For the period 1980-2016 we report the figures as published in OECD SOCX. For the period 1960-1979, we extended the recent figures (from OECD SOCX) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1985). And for the period 1880-1930, we took observations from Lindert (2004).
  
  To be precise, the data for the period 1960-1979 was obtained by relying on the earliest available observation from OECD SOCX, and then successively extending the series backwards by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD (1985). Here is an example:
  
  OECD_SOCX_(Year-1) = [OECD_SOCX_(Year)] x [OECD_1985_(year-1)]/[ OECD_1985_(year)]
  
  Backward extrapolation for the period 1960-1979 was necessary because the levels in the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. The implicit assumption, then, is that the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) have different levels, but common trends.
  
  In this visualization (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/various-measures-of-social-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp?country=AUS) you can see how the various underlying sources compare to our constructed series.
  
  Further remarks
  
  According to the Manual to the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), the OECD defines social expenditure as “The provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or transfer”
  
  The series on Social expenditure for France and Denmark in OECD(1985) are not complete. However, Lindert (2004) uses the data available to estimate social expenditure in 1960 and 1970. Therefore, we use his estimations to extrapolate backwards for those two points in time.
  
  In OECD (1985) social expenditure figures include expenditure on education. To ensure consistency with Lindert (2004) and OECD (SOCX), we subtracted education.

  OurWorldinData have extended this series for the years 2015 and 2016. Cumulative capacity data has been sourced from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Resource, which reports global solar PV installed capacity. Available at: http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/
  
  Cost data for the years 2015 and 2016 are sourced from the 'PVX spot market price index for solar PV modules' from Solar Server. These have been calculated as the annual average from monthly spot prices for the Chinese series (which is the closest representation of earlier Navigant data). Prices have been converted from Euros to dollars using a conversion factor of 1.19.

  # Son preference in education - World Values Survey (2014)
  
  Share of people who say they are 'agree' or 'strongly agree' with the statement  "A university education is more important for a boy than for a girl". Possible answers include 'Strongly Agree', 'Agree', 'Disagree', 'Strongly Disagree' and 'Don't Know'. Our estimates exclude those answering 'Don't Know'.
  
  The methodology followed for constructing the variable is as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Created a dichotomous son preference variable, combining responses of strongly agree (strongly disagree), and agree (disagree)., where 1=agree and 0=disagree </li>
  <li>Generated a variable for the number of respondents in each country, by survey year </li>
  <li>Summed to give the total number of people who 'agree' or 'strongly agree' with the above statement and the total number of surveyed responses, for each country in each year </li>
  <li>Calculated the % of respondents who agree university is more important for boys = (number of people who agree or strongly agree with the statement / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
  </ul>
  Note: For India in 2014, we have used the WVS Online Data Analysis tool to overwrite the initial value obtained from our methodology using the longitudinal dataset as it appears to be too high (62.14%) when comparing it with the WVS estimates (38.50%). It has been calculated as follows: % who strongly agree or agree university education for boys is more important than for girls = ((761+676)/3732)*100. This estimate also excludes those answering 'Don't Know'.
  
  The number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year. Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution.

  To calculate country exports to the rest of the world, the total value of exports by country, per year, is divided by the country's GDP. Calculations use Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) dyadic trade data.
  
  The time series 'World' corresponds to the World's total exports (i.e. the sum of exports reported by all countries in the dataset).
  
  The total export values of regional income aggregates have been calculated using the World Bank's income groupings.
  
  Germany's time series is comprised of West Germany, and Germany. East Germany has been excluded for the purposes of Germany's calculations but is included in the World series.
  Russia's time series comprises Russia and the USSR. 
  
  Continental groupings are defined according to OWID's classification. Europe has been split into Western Europe including: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Remaining European countries have been classified as Eastern Europe.

  # State-based battle deaths since 1946 by world region (UCDP-PRIO)
  
  The region refers not to the location of the battle but to the location of the primary state or states involved in the conflict. In most cases this also happens to be the world region where the battle deaths occurred. This is true even where there was foreign state involvement from other world regions, but where that foreign state was not the primary state involved in the 'incompatibility' (e.g. territorial or governmental dispute). For instance in the Vietnam War, the region is listed as Asia, despite significant US involvement, since the primary state involved in the territorial dispute was South Vietnam. Conversely, the conflict listed as being between the US and al-Qaida is ascribed to the Americas, despite the fighting mostly taking place in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East (with the exception of the September 11 attacks on US soil in 2001). In the most recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the conflicts are ascribed multiple regions since in each case one of the sides was composed of a coalition of states from different regions (i.e. the US and UK). In these cases, we apportion the death count evenly between the number of world regions listed.

  # Suicides from pesticides (Mew et al., 2017)
  
  Mew et al. (2017) estimated the share and number of suicide deaths globally and regionally which resulted from pesticide poisoning.
  
  The authors did so using:
  "WHO method-specific suicide data were supplemented by a systematic review of the literature between 2006 and 2015, including searches of thirteen electronic databases and Google, citation searching and a review of reference lists and personal collections. Our primary outcome was the proportion of total suicides due to pesticide poisoning. Weighted estimates were calculated for seven WHO regional and income strata."

  # Supercomputer power (FLOPS)- TOP500 Database
  
  Data on supercomputer power is sourced from the TOP500 database which tracks and reports the 500 largest supercomputers on a bi-annual basis. 
  
  Supercomputer power is measured in Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) is a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.

  # Supply chain loss of calories - FAO (2017)
  
  This data was calculated by OurWorldinData based on UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) datasets.
  
  Total calories lost through the supply chain were calculated by multiplying FAO figures on losses (within its Food Balance Sheets), measured in thousand tonnes per year, by average commodity-specific nutritional factors as published by the FAO.
  
  For example, the total caloric losses of wheat was derived by multiplying each country's wheat losses (in thousand tonnes) by caloric density of wheat (measured in kcal per 100 grams). Combining caloric losses for each commodity gives the total losses across all commodity types.
  
  The average caloric supply chain loss per person per day were derived by dividing total caloric losses by a country's total population, and by 365.

  # Teacher Absenteeism - Bold et al. (2017)
  
  The data comes from Table 2 in the source paper with the following note: " The table reports the absence rate for all teachers, the scheduled teaching time, actual teaching time and number of orphaned classrooms for all government
  schools. Teachers are marked as absent from school if during the second unannounced visit, they are not found anywhere on the school premises. Otherwise, they are marked as present. Teachers are marked as absent from class if during the second unannounced visit, they are absent from school or present at school but absent from the classroom. Otherwise, they are marked as present. The scheduled teaching time is the length of the school day minus break time. Time spent teaching adjusts the length of the school day by the share of teachers who are present in the classroom, on average, and the time the teacher spends teaching while in the classroom. The orphaned classrooms measure is the ratio of the classrooms with students but no teacher to the number of classrooms with students with or without a teacher. All individual country statistics are calculated using country-specific sampling weights. The average for all countries is taken by averaging over the country columns. Hence, each country is given equal weight. Further details on the construction of the variables and sampling weights are available in an Appendix available from the authors upon request.

  # Temporary accommodation in England - UK Government (2018)
  
  Figures report the number of households, households with children and number of children in 'temporary accommodation' (TA).
  
  Temporary accommodation (typically given for a period of 28 days or less) is allocated to households without permanent housing, and are therefore included in annual homelessness accounts. Temporary accommodation includes relocation to bed and breakfasts, hostels, shelters, local authority or privately-owned temporary accommodation.
  
  The UK National Statistics note: "Complete temporary accommodation data was provided by 299 (92%) local authorities. A further 23 local authorities did provide a return but their totals have been omitted from the release due to quality concerns that placements may have been underreported or double reported."
  
  Temporary accommodation data is reported quarterly: to maintain consistency with rough sleeper statistics (recorded in Autumn) we have assumed Q3 results for each year.

  # Terrorism incidents, fatalities & injuries (Global Terrorism Database, 2018)
  
  The Global Terrorism Database definitions can be found at (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf) and are as follows:
  
  A terrorist incident is included in GTD if it is the following:
  - The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.
  - The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.
  - The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.
  
  In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:
  - Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
  - Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
  - Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants).
  
  Is it defined as a suicide attack?
  This variable is coded “Yes” in those cases where there is evidence that the perpetrator did not intend to escape from the attack alive. 
  
  Successful vs. unsuccessful attacks:
  "The GTD does include attacks that were attempted but ultimately unsuccessful. The circumstances vary depending on tactics (for details see the success variable, below). However, in general if a bomb is planted but fails to detonate; if an arsonist is intercepted by authorities before igniting a fire; or, if an assassin attempts and fails to kill his or her intended target, the attack is considered for inclusion in the GTD, but denoted as unsuccessful.
  
  Success of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack. Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression. The definition of a successful attack depends on the type of attack. Essentially, the key question is whether or not the attack type took place. If a case has multiple attack types, it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the exception of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed."
  
  Fatalities are defined as:
  "The number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident. The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident. Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident."
  
  Injuries are:
  "the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims."

  # Terrorist attack by target type - Global Terrorism Database (2018)
  
  As explained by the Global Terrorism Database (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf):
  
  Data denotes the general type of target/victim. When a victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive. For
  example, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” 
  
  This variable consists of the following 22 categories:
  1 = BUSINESS
  Businesses are defined as individuals or organizations engaged in commercial or mercantile activity as a means of livelihood. Any attack on a business or private citizens patronizing a business such as a restaurant, gas station, music store, bar, café, etc. This includes attacks carried out against corporate offices or employees of firms like mining companies, or oil corporations. Furthermore, includes attacks conducted on business people or corporate officers. Included in this value as well are hospitals and chambers of commerce and cooperatives. Does not include attacks carried out in public or quasi-public areas such as “business district or commercial area”, or generic business-related individuals such as
  “businessmen” (these attacks are captured under “Private Citizens and Property”, see below.) Also does not include attacks against generic business-related individuals such as “businessmen.” Unless the victims were targeted because of their specific business affiliation, these attacks belong in “Private Citizens and Property.”
  
  2 = GOVERNMENT (GENERAL)
  Any attack on a government building; government member, former members, including members of political parties in official capacities, their convoys, or events sponsored by political parties; political movements; or a government sponsored institution where the attack is expressly carried out to harm the government. This value includes attacks on judges, public attorneys (e.g., prosecutors), courts and court systems, politicians, royalty, head of state, government employees (unless police or military), election-related attacks, or intelligence agencies and spies. This value does not include attacks on political candidates for office or members of political parties that do not hold an elected office (these attacks are captured in “Private Citizens and Property”).
  
  3 = POLICE
  This value includes attacks on members of the police force or police installations; this includes police boxes, patrols headquarters, academies, cars, checkpoints, etc. Includes attacks against jails or prison facilities, or jail or prison staff or guards.
  
  4 = MILITARY

Moreover, includes attacks against religious schools in this value. As noted below in the “Private Citizens and Property” value, the GTD has several attacks against students. If attacks involving students are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are carried out in an educational setting, they are coded as private citizens and property. Excludes attacks against military schools (attacks on military schools are coded as “Military,” see below).
  
  9 = FOOD OR WATER SUPPLY
  Attacks on food or water supplies or reserves are included in this value. This generally includes attacks aimed at the infrastructure related to food and water for human consumption.

Also includes ambiguous cases where the target/victim was a named individual, or where the target/victim of an attack could be identified by name, age, occupation, gender or nationality. This value also includes ceremonial events, such as weddings and funerals. The GTD contains a number of attacks against students. If these attacks are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are not carried out in an educational setting, these attacks are coded using this value. Also, includes incidents involving political supporters as private citizens and property, provided that these supporters are not part of a government-sponsored event. Finally, this value includes police informers. Does not include attacks causing civilian casualties in businesses such as restaurants, cafes or movie theaters (these categories are coded as “Business” see above).
  
  15 = RELIGIOUS FIGURES/INSTITUTIONS

Travel agencies are coded as business targets.
  
  19 = TRANSPORTATION (OTHER THAN AVIATION)
  Attacks on public transportation systems are included in this value. This can include efforts to assault public buses, minibuses, trains, metro/subways, highways (if the highway itself is the target of the attack), bridges, roads, etc. The GTD contains a number of attacks on generic terms such as “cars” or “vehicles.” These attacks are assumed to be against “Private Citizens and Property” unless shown to be against public transportation systems. In this regard, buses are assumed to be public transportation unless otherwise noted.
  
  20 = UNKNOWN
  The target type cannot be determined from the available information.

  # Terrorist attacks by type - Global Terrorism Database (2018)
  
  This metric captures the general method of a terrorist attack and often reflects the broad class of tactics used. It consists of nine categories, which are defined below.
  
  1 = ASSASSINATION
  An act whose primary objective is to kill one or more specific, prominent individuals. Usually carried out on persons of some note, such as highranking military officers, government officials, celebrities, etc. Not to include attacks on non-specific members of a targeted group. The killing of a police officer would be an armed assault unless there is reason to believe the attackers singled out a particularly prominent officer for assassination.
  
  2 = ARMED ASSAULT
  An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by use of a firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Not to include attacks involving the use of fists, rocks, sticks, or other handheld (less-than-lethal) weapons. Also includes attacks involving certain classes of explosive devices in addition to firearms, incendiaries, or sharp instruments. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown.
  
  3 = BOMBING/EXPLOSION
  An attack where the primary effects are caused by an energetically unstable material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage to the surrounding environment. Can include either high or low explosives (including a dirty bomb) but does not include a nuclear explosive device that releases energy from fission and/or fusion, or an incendiary device where decomposition takes place at a much slower rate. If an attack involves certain classes of explosive devices along with firearms, incendiaries, or sharp objects, then the attack is coded as an armed assault only. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown in which the bombers are also using firearms or incendiary devices.
  
  4 = HIJACKING
  An act whose primary objective is to take control of a vehicle such as an aircraft, boat, bus, etc. for the purpose of diverting it to an unprogrammed  destination, force the release of prisoners, or some other political objective. Obtaining payment of a ransom should not the sole purpose of a Hijacking, but can be one element of the incident so long as additional objectives have also been stated. Hijackings are distinct from Hostage Taking because the target is a vehicle, regardless of whether there are people/passengers in the vehicle.
  
  5 = HOSTAGE TAKING (BARRICADE INCIDENT)
  An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Such attacks are distinguished from kidnapping since the incident occurs and usually plays out at the target location with little or no intention to hold the hostages for an extended period in a separate clandestine location.
  
  6 = HOSTAGE TAKING (KIDNAPPING)
  An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Kidnappings are distinguished from Barricade Incidents (above) in that they involve moving and holding the hostages in another location.
  
  7 = FACILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACK
  An act, excluding the use of an explosive, whose primary objective is to cause damage to a non-human target, such as a building, monument, train, pipeline, etc. Such attacks include arson and various forms of sabotage (e.g., sabotaging a train track is a facility/infrastructure attack, even if passengers are killed). Facility/infrastructure attacks can include acts which aim to harm an installation, yet also cause harm to people incidentally (e.g. an arson attack primarily aimed at damaging a building, but causes injuries or fatalities).
  
  8 = UNARMED ASSAULT
  An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by any means other than explosive, firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Attacks involving chemical, biological or radiological weapons are considered unarmed assaults.
  
  9 = UNKNOWN
  The attack type cannot be determined from the available information.

  # Terrorist attacks by weapon type - Global Terrorism Database (2018)
  
  The general weapon used in a given terrorist attack is recorded in the following categories:
  
  1 = Biological
  A weapon whose components are produced from pathogenic microorganisms or toxic substances of biological origins.
  
  2 = Chemical
  A weapon produced from toxic chemicals that is contained in a delivery system and dispersed as a liquid, vapor, or aerosol. This category includes chemical weapons delivered via explosive device.
  
  3 = Radiological
  A weapon whose components are produced from radioactive materials that emit ionizing radiation and can take many forms.
  
  4 = Nuclear
  A weapon which draws its explosive force from fission, fusion, or a combination of these methods.
  
  5 = Firearms
  A weapon which is capable of firing a projectile using an explosive charge as a propellant.
  
  6 = Explosives
  A weapon composed of energetically unstable material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage to the surrounding environment. Note that chemical weapons delivered via explosive are classified as “Chemical” with weapon subtype “Explosives.”
  
  7 = Fake Weapons
  A weapon that was claimed by the perpetrator at the time of the incident to be real but was discovered after-the-fact to be non-existent or incapable of producing the desired effects.
  
  8 = Incendiary
  A weapon that is capable of catching fire, causing fire, or burning readily and produces intensely hot fire when exploded.
  
  9 = Melee
  A weapon—targeting people rather than property—that does not involve a projectile in which the user and target are in contact with it simultaneously.
  
  10 = Vehicle
  An automobile that is used in an incident that does not incorporate the use of explosives such as a car bomb or truck bomb.
  
  11 = Sabotage Equipment
  A weapon that is used in the demolition or destruction of property (e.g., removing bolts from a train tracks).
  
  12 = Other
  A weapon that has been identified but does not fit into one of the above categories.
  
  13 = Unknown
  The weapon type cannot be determined from the available information.

  # Tetanus Neonatal Rate - calculated from WHO incidence (2017) and WDI population data - Hannah Behrens
  
  Neonatal tetanus incidence per 1,000,000 people based on WHO neonatal tetanus incidence dataset 2017 (already on grapher) and WDI total population dataset (already on grapher). 
  
  No population data was available for Niue (all years), Kuwait (1992-1994), Eritrea (2013-2016). The neonatal tetanus incidence was zero. Population size does therefore not matter to calculate the rate, as it will be zero regardless of the population size.
  
  No population data was available for Swaziland (all years) and (Serbia 1980-1989). They were therefore excluded.

  # Time spent on domestic work – UN (2017) and OECD (2014)
  
  This dataset is an excerpt from the data provided by the United Nations Statistics Division under the Minimum Set of Gended Indicators. 
  Cross-country comparability is limited due to lack of uniform definitions. Importantly, the ages of the relevant population differ from country to country (and in a few instances, they also differ from year to year for the same country). For most low-income countries, the figures include children among the relevant population. For most high-income countries, children below 15 are excluded. Additionally, in some countries the estimates correspond only to specific regions (e.g. urban). This file provides a column with notes explaining the particular reference population in each case.
  
  Regarding the definitions, the original source notes: "Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof) regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants or both. Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated)."

  # Time spent, participation time, and participation rates - Eurostat
  
  This Eurostat data set measures the time spent, participation time, and participation rate in 55 activities. 
  
  For the purposes of illustrating how time use has changed over time, we have aggregated the 55 activities under six main headings provided in the original Eurostat source. The six headings are (1) Personal care; (2) Employment, related activities, and travel; (3) Study; (4) Household and family care; (5) Leisure, social, and associative life; and (6) Travel and unspecified time use. The data has been normalised to 1440 minutes per day. 
  
  The survey population includes private participants only - individuals living in institutions (nursing homes, homes for the elderly, children’s homes, rehabilitation centres and penitentiary) are excluded. For further information on the time use surveys see: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tus_esms.htm

  # Time that doctors spend with a patient - Das, Hammer, and Leonard (2008)
  
  India figures refer to Delhi and cannot be applied nationwide. Values for the United Kingdom and Spain represent the time spent with the doctor after a nurse or assistant has taken basic health measures from the patient. Data taken from Table 2 of the paper linked above.
  
  Underlying sources: : India—Das and Hammer (2007); Paraguay—Das and Sohnesen (2007); Tanzania—based on calculations by Kenneth Leonard; International Comparisons—Hogelzeir et al. (1993) and Deveugele, Derese, Brink-Muinen, Bensing, and De Maeseneer (2003).
  
  The timing of recorded values differ country to country. Hence, cross country comparisons should be made with caution. See the underlying sources for further information on the countries included and dates surveys were conducted.

  # Time use across activities - OECD Gender data (2018)
  
  Australia, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, China time use estimates are not fully comparable, due to differences in the age of reference. The remaining countries' age of reference are between 15-64.
  
  Note: Data are normalized to 1440 minutes per day. In other words, for those countries for which the time use does not sum up to 1440 minutes, the missing minutes are equally distributed across all activities. 
  
  The survey years also differ amongst the countries included. The second link above includes a breakdown of the minutes spent in sub-activities that make up each of the five activities in this dataset: paid work or study, unpaid work, personal care, leisure, and other (which includes religious/spiritual activities and civic obligations).

  # Total Economy Productivity - OECD
  
  Total economic productivity is measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked across all economic sectors of the economy. This is measured in 2010 US dollars, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). 
  
  OECD define this metric as: "GDP per hour worked is a measure of labour productivity. It measures how efficiently labour input is combined with other factors of production and used in the production process. Labour input is defined as total hours worked of all persons engaged in production. Labour productivity only partially reflects the productivity of labour in terms of the personal capacities of workers or the intensity of their effort. The ratio between the output measure and the labour input depends to a large degree on the presence and/or use of other inputs (e.g. capital, intermediate inputs, technical, organisational and efficiency change, economies of scale). This indicator is measured in USD (constant prices 2010 and PPPs) and indices."

  # Total Economy Productivity Growth - OECD
  
  Data reports the annual growth rate (%) in productivity, measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked across all sectors of the economy. Percentage growth data is derived from underlying productivity data measured in 2010 USD PPP. 
  
  The OECD note: "Productivity is a key driver of economic growth and changes in living standards. Labour productivity growth implies a higher level of output for unit of labour input (hours worked or persons employed). This can be achieved if more capital is used in production or through improved overall efficiency with which labour and capital are used together, i.e., higher multifactor productivity growth (MFP). Productivity is also a key driver of international competitiveness, e.g. as measured by Unit Labour Costs (ULC)."

  # Total gross official disbursements for medical research and basic heath sectors - OECD
  
  The sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows from all donors to developing countries for medical research and basic health.
  
  ODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients
  and to multilateral institutions which are:
  i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive
  agencies; and
  ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).
  
  Medical research and basic health sectors are as defined by the DAC. Medical research refers to CRS
  sector code 12182 and basic health covers all codes in the 122 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).

  # Total value of exports by country to world (%GDP) (OWID calculations based on Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) and other sources)
  
  Whenever possible, the source reports data on merchandise trade, excluding trade in services and re-exports. Some specific goods are also excluded (the authors highlight the omission of bullion and species in historical data).
  
  Since re-exports are excluded, special import data is favored over general import data (special imports have the importing country as their final destination, whereas general trade is composed of special trade, together with transit trade).
  
  To calculate total exports to the rest of the world as a share of GDP, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:
  
  UK-exports-to-the-world-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three countries in the entire sample constituting the rest of the world).
  
  Export values used rely on the estimate given by the importer as the authors note: "importers have a greater incentive to properly assess trade flows as they are commonly subject to duties". Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current British pounds.
  
   Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) data uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) dataset extensively from 1948 until the present day.
  
  West Germany estimates have been used between 1950 - 1990, and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990. Estimates for East Germany have been excluded. Please see the original document providing a detailed description of the data set used, including country and territory definitions, available at: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=9134
  
  Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and the Bahamas have also been excluded from the sample due to insufficient data availability.

  # Trade share by type of trade (OWID calculations based on NBER- United Nations Trade Data 1962-2000)
  
  The total value of exports calculated for the NBER-United Nations Datasets includes only trade in goods, classified according to the 4 digit Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 2. Authors give primacy to importers' reports whenever they are available, assumed to be more accurate.
  
  OWID calculations have excluded all observations for the 'World' with the focus on bilateral country trade flows. Countries Comoros, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Netherlands Antilles have also been excluded from the sample as, in the case of the former two, multiple countries are included in these labels in the NBER-UN data, and hence would be inaccurate to calculate the trade share by national GDP. For the Netherlands Antilles there is insufficient alternative trade data by the World Bank and other sources to check whether the figures are correctly estimated. 
  
  The United Kingdom consists of: the UK, British Antarctic Territories, the Falkland Islands, and Saint Helena. 
  Germany consists of: East Germany, West Germany, and Germany. 
  Russia: the former USSR and Russia. 
  France: French Guinea, Guadeloupe, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and France. 
  Yemen: the Yemen Arab Republic, the Yemen People's Republic, and Yemen. 
  
  All countries defined to be resource rich have been excluded from the sample. The list of these countries include: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana, Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix 1, Table 1. 
  
  Capital vs labor intensive countries have been categorised using the World Bank's 2016 income classification. Low and lower-middle income countries have been classified as labor intensive while upper-middle and high-income countries as capital intensive. The 2016 classification has been applied to all previous years for which there is data.
  
  To calculate export trade share to labor-intensive countries, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:
  UK-exports-to-labor-intensive-countries-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three developing countries in the entire sample).

  # Trade share with capital- and labor-intensive countries (OWID calculations based on Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016))
  
  Capital and labor-intensive countries have been defined according to the World Bank’s 2016 income classifications as our starting point. Low and lower-middle income countries have been classified as labor-intensive while upper-middle income and high income countries as capital-intensive. The 2016 classification has been applied to all previous years for which there is data available. Where no World Bank classification is available for self-governing territories, the observation is assigned the country classification to which it is related. For example, Saint Pierre and Miquelon would be assigned France's income classification. 
  
  All countries defined to be resource rich have been excluded from the sample to focus on the trade between rich countries and countries that are labor-abundant but capital and resource poor. The list of resource rich countries excluded are: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana, Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix 1, Table 1.

  This data also correlates to that published in 'The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology' by Ray Kurzweil up to 2003. Available at: http://www.singularity.com/index.html
  
  Where data of several microprocessors is given for a single year, we have shown the highest transistor count per chip of that year.
  
  Data for 2015 and 2017 have been updated by OurWorldinData based on highest transistor count noted at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count. The 2015 record was set by Oracle's 32-core SPARC M7 (https://www.enterprisetech.com/2014/08/13/oracle-cranks-cores-32-sparc-m7-chip/) and in 2017 by the 32-core AMD Epyc microprocessor.

  The Wellcome Global Monitor is the world’s largest study into how people around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges. It surveys over 140,000 people from more than 140 countries.
  
  Survey respondents were asked, "How much do you trust each of the following: other people in you neighborhood; your national government; scientists; journalists; doctors and nurses; people who work at non-governmental or non-profit organizations; healers? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all?"
  
  The "share of people who trust" is the sum of those who responded "a lot", and "some".

  # UK Cholera Death over the long-term - ONS
  
  Data has been compiled by Our World in Data across various historical sources.
  
  Data on 19th century outbreaks of cholera were sourced from Thomas, A. J. (2015) and Pearson Schools and Colleges, Poverty, public health and the state in Britain, c1780–1939. Note that this data represents total death toll for major pandemic years (and is given as the total death toll for the outbreak period e.g. in data for 1832 represents the total deaths across the 1831-32 outbreak). The death toll from cholera between these outbreaks was much lower than such peaks, although exact figures are not known. These are given as the total death toll in Great Britain (representing England, Wales and Scotland).
  
  
  Data from 1910 onward is for England and Wales only. This data is derived from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).

  # UN Population by age group to 2100 - UN Population Statistics Division (2017)
  
  Projected population by age group. Population trends for the under 15 age group have been calculated as the sum of all age groups up to 14 years old. Over 15 constitutes all individuals aged 15 or above. The total constitutes the sum of both age categories.

  # UNESCO metadata on literacy (UIS (2017))
  
  The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) collects cross-national education statistics. Data on literacy rates come from a variety of sources (such as national censuses and surveys) and reporting modes (self-reporting vs household declarations). 
  
  Data instruments used to estimate literacy are grouped under three main types: i) a census; ii) a survey; or iii) indirect estimates. Indirect estimates are extrapolated - based on educational attainment, or estimated based on the country's census.
  
  Methodologies used for measuring literacy have been grouped into four categories: household declarations, self declarations, literacy tests, and national estimates. Both household and self-declared literacy are self-reports; in the former, it is the head of the household responding to the survey, and in the latter it is directly reported by the individuals themselves.
  
  UNESCO categorised Chile's (2009) and the Philippines' (2003) mode of literacy reporting as 'Household/Self declaration'. We have categorised the two countries under the household declaration category.

  # US Corn Yields - USDA (2017) & FAO (2017)
  
  This dataset comprises of a combination of two datasets: one from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
  
  Data for the years 1866-1960 has been taken from the USDA-NASS database. This reports survey data on corn yields in bushels per acre. To convert these values to tonnes per hectare, we have used a conversion factor of 0.06725.
  
  Data from 1961 onwards has been sourced from the UN FAOstats database. Here, corn yields are termed 'maize'. The FAO yields are reported in 100g per hectare. To convert to tonnes per hectare, we applied a conversion factor of 0.0001.

  # US Maternal Mortality and FLFP Index - OWID (2017)
  
  The maternal mortality index was calculated by OWID based on maternal mortality data compiled from Gapminder (historical data) and the World Bank (recent data). The original data shows maternal death per 100,000 live births.
  
  For more detail see: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality.
  The index measures maternal mortality as an index to 1900. This was calculated by dividing maternal mortality in each year by maternal mortality in 1900 (therefore 1900 = 100). Values less than 100 indicate a decrease in maternal mortality relative to 1900; values greater than 100 indicate an increase in maternal mortality relative to 1900.

  # Under 5 mortality rate [Our World in Data]
  
  We have combined two sources: The UN Child Mortality Estimates (CME) data and the Human Mortality Database (HMD).
  
  All data points from the CME used. HMD has been used as a supplement when CME data is not available for a given year. HMD values are multiplied by factor of 1.1 for Belarus, Hungary and Lithuania (to match CME data as described in Hill et al. 2012). HMD values are multiplied by a factor of 1.2 for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia (before 1992) (to match CME as described in Hill et al. 2012).
  
  Hill et al. 2012 adjust the CME data by these same factors because of concerns about the low levels of early neonatal death recorded in the civil registration systems of these countries compared to western European countries as a result of differences in the definition of live births.

  # Unemployment rate, ages 15-24, by education - ILOSTAT (2017)
  
  The unemployment rate is the number of persons who are unemployed as a percent of the total number of employed and unemployed persons (i.e., the labour force). Data by level of education are provided on the highest level of education completed.
  
  According to the ISCED-11 classification, a 'less than basic education' may refer to no schooling, or early childhood education.  'Basic education' includes primary or lower secondary education; 'Intermediate education' to upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education; 'Advanced education' can refer to short-cycle tertiary education, Bachelor's or equivalent level, Master's or equivalent level, or Doctoral or equivalent level, while 'level not stated' is an education level not elsewhere classified.

  # Unintended pregnancy rates (per 1000 women) - Bearak et al. (2018)
  
  To estimate the unintended pregnancy rate, the authors "used a Bayesian hierarchical time series model in which the dependent variable was the number of unintended pregnancies among all women of reproductive age in a given country and year. The predictors were the numbers of women of reproductive age in each of the three subgroups of women (married women with an unmet need, married women experiencing failure with a contraceptive method, and all unmarried women)."
  
  This is measured as the number of unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-44 years old).
  
  Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.

  # Urban definition - population threshold (UN; 2018)
  
  Data was assessed by Our World in Data based on UN documentation of its Urbanization Prospects (2018). The Urbanization Prospects presents data on the number and share of the population residing in urban areas for each country from 1950 with projections to 2050.
  
  There is no consistent definition of what constitutes an 'urban area'. This is highly variable across countries. This data presents a given country's minimum threshold of inhabitants needed for it to be defined an 'urban area'. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.
  
  Note that some countries with minimum inhabitant thresholds noted here also include additional qualities (such as population density) to be met.

  Data on the total size of urban populations living in slums was calculated by Our World in Data based on metrics published within the World Bank, World Development Indicators: 'Urban population (total)' and '% urban population living in slums'.
  
  Population living in slums is the proportion of the urban population living in slum households. A slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, and durability of housing.

  # Urbanization in the long run - OWID based on the UN World Urbanization Prospects 2018 and others
  
  To construct the long run urbanization series we began with the UN World Urbanization Prospects database covering the period from 1950 to 2050. 
  
  Then we extended the series backwards using additional data sources including the US Census Bureau, Bairoch (1988), Kuroda (1984), HYDE 3.1 (2010), and De Vries (1984) to arrive at the longest single series possible for each country and region included. For further information on the source used for particular observations by country-year, see the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tl3FmKTD_FaQ-i4VUlusS-OcZHOl30zkK7oIsuQPtJ4/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
  
  To calculate the absolute rural and urban populations, we have multiplied the rural and urban percentages by the historic population series published by Gapminder until 1949 and extended using the UN Population Division data from 1950 to 2016. The long run 'Gapminder + UN Population' population series is available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-country-gapminder+un" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.  For absolute population estimates before 1950 for the 'World', we used the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-1750-2015-and-un-projection-until-2100" rel="noopener" target="_blank">'World Population over 12,000 years' series</a>.
  
  Note: Urbanization data for Japan in 1900 has been excluded as the estimate (HYDE 3.1) was inconsistent with figures for neighbouring years (Kuroda (1986)).

  # Urbanization share (European Commission, Atlas of the Human Planet)
  
  Data reports the share of people living in urban areas, as reported by the European Commission project. These results differ significantly from UN and nationally-defined figures based on differences in methodology.
  
  The European Commission combines high-resolution satellite imagery with national census data to derive its estimates of urban and rural settlements.
  
  The European Commission applied a universal definition of settlements across all countries:
  
  - Urban centre: must have a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 1500 people per square kilometre (km2) or density of build-up area greater than 50 percent.
  - Urban cluster: must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 300 people per square kilometre (km2).
  - Rural: fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.
  
  The urban share is thereafter defined as the sum of urban centres and urban clusters.

  # Value of global merchandise imports and exports - (Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) National data)
  
  To calculate country exports (imports) to (from) the rest of the world, the total value of exports (imports) by country, per year, is divided by the country's GDP. Calculations use Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) national trade data.
  
  The time series 'World' corresponds to the World's total exports (imports) (i.e. the sum of exports (imports) reported by all countries in the dataset).
  
  The total export (import) values of regional income aggregates have been calculated using the World Bank's income groupings. These time series begin in 1970, where the number of countries are more representative. Similarly, total export (import) values by continental grouping begin in 1960. 
  
  Germany's time series is comprised of West Germany, and Germany. East Germany has been excluded for the purposes of Germany's calculations.
  Russia's time series comprises Russia and the USSR.

  – The source notes that in some instances observations differ from the standard definition or refer to only part of a country. 
  
  – The dates associated to each observation correspond to the end of the survey used as underlying source 
  
  – Most estimates come from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). The MICS include a standard set of questions covering different disciplinary methods. It does allow survey respondents to report both violent and nonviolent forms of discipline.
  
  –The source notes that estimates reported in UNICEF publications and in MICS country reports prior to 2010 were calculated using household weights that did not take into account the last-stage selection of children for the administration of the child discipline module in MICS surveys. (A random selection of one child aged 2–14 is undertaken for the administration of the child discipline module.) In January 2010, it was decided that more accurate estimates are produced by using a household weight that takes the last-stage selection into account. MICS3 data were recalculated using this approach. All estimates produced after 2010 use the revised estimates.
  
  – When it was first implemented in MICS3, the child discipline module was administered only to mothers/primary caregivers, who were asked whether any of the disciplinary methods covered in the module had been used by any member of the household during the month preceding the interview. Beginning with MICS4, the methodology was changed: Any adult household member, not just the mother or primary caregiver, can now respond to the questions on child discipline.

  # Water footprint food products - Mekonnen & Hoekstra
  
  Water footprints are given as the global weighted average figure of crop and animal product production. Water footprints are measured over their full supply chain (for example, water requirements for livestock products includes that from animal feed). 
  
  They include blue, green and grey water components, which the Water Footprint Network define as:
  - Blue Water: "Volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result of the production of a good or service. Consumption refers to the volume of freshwater used and then evaporated or incorporated into a product. It also includes water abstracted from surface or groundwater in a catchment and returned to another catchment or the sea. It is the amount of water abstracted from groundwater or surface water that does not return to the catchment from which it was withdrawn."
  
  - Green Water: "The precipitation on land that does not run off or recharge the groundwater but is stored in the soil or temporarily stays on top of the soil or vegetation. Eventually, this part of precipitation evaporates or transpires through plants. Green water can be made productive for crop growth (although not all green water can be taken up by crops, because there will always be evaporation from the soil and because not all periods of the year or areas are suitable for crop growth)."
  
  - Grey Water: "The grey water footprint of a product is an indicator of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the production of a product over its full supply chain. It is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards. It is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water remains above agreed water quality standards."

  # Water withdrawals and consumption - Aquastat
  
  Data definitions for each variable included in the AQUASTAT Database is as follows:
  
  Agricultural water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal."
  
  Industrial water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial uses. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%. It includes water for the cooling of thermoelectric and nuclear power plants, but it does not include hydropower. Water withdrawn by industries that are connected to the public supply network is generally included in municipal water withdrawal."
  
  Municipal water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for the direct use by the population. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries and urban agriculture, which is connected to the municipal network. The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas."
  
  Irrigation water requirement: "The quantity of water exclusive of precipitation and soil moisture (i.e. quantity of irrigation water) required for normal crop production. It consists of water to ensure that the crop receives its full crop water requirement (i.e. irrigation consumptive water use, as well as extra water for flooding of paddy fields to facilitate land preparation and protect the plant and for leaching salt when necessary to allow for plant growth). It is usually expressed in water depth (millimetres) or water volume (m3) and may be stated in monthly, seasonal or annual terms, or for a crop period. It corresponds to net irrigation water requirement."
  
  Irrigation water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes. In the AQUASTAT database water withdrawal for irrigation is part of agricultural water withdrawal, together with water withdrawal for livestock (watering and cleaning) and water withdrawal for aquaculture. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation by far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops. The term "water requirement ratio" (sometimes also called "irrigation efficiency") is used to indicate the ratio between the net irrigation water requirements or crop water requirements, which is the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the growing period of the crop, and the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation including the losses. In the specific case of paddy rice irrigation, additional water is needed for flooding to facilitate land preparation and for plant protection. In that case, irrigation water requirements are the sum of rainfall deficit and the water needed to flood paddy fields. At scheme level, water requirement ratio values can vary from less than 20 percent to more than 80 percent."
  
  Total water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn for agricultural, industrial and municipal purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It does not include in-stream uses, which are characterized by a very low net consumption rate, such as recreation, navigation, hydropower, inland capture fisheries, etc."

  # Weather fatality rates in the US – OWID based on NOAA and Lopez Holle and population data
  
  Data on the annual fatalities (since 1940) to various weather events in the US is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service. This dataset is online here: http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/victims.shtml
  Data on lightning from lightning earlier than 1991 is not from this dataset from NOAA, but from the Lopez and Holle paper cited below. 
  
  I have calculated the fatality rate based on the NOAA fatality counts and estimates of the US population. These estimates are based on US census data for the period before 1960 and on World Bank data for the period since then.
  
  The US census data is online here: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1900-1980/national/totals/popclockest.txt
  The World Bank estimates are online here: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
  
  
  Data on the lightning fatality rate until 1990 is from Raúl E. Lopez and Ronald L. Holle (1997) – Changes in the Number of Lightning Deaths in the United States during the Twentieth Century. Journal of Climate; Volume 11.
  This fatality rate is not calculated for the entire US since in earlier periods not all US states reported the number of annual fatalities. (In the calculation of the fatality rate Lopez and Holle have taken only the population of the reporting states into account so that the population in the numerator and the denominator refer to the same group of people.)

  # Weekly home production hours in the USA - Ramey (2009) & Ramey Francis (2009)
  
  Following Ramey and Francis (2009), "the activities included in home production are: planning, purchasing goods and services (except medical and personal care services), care of children and adults (both in the household and outside the household), general cleaning, care and repair of the house and grounds (including yard work, but excluding gardening), preparing and clearing food, making, mending, and laundering of clothing and other household textiles.".
  Ramey and Francis (2009) estimations are based on data assembled by Ramey (2009).
  
  Ramey (2009)'s data are assembled and estimated from samples based on a multitude of different sources, including diaries, U.S. census, historical statistics, and surveys from the Bureau of Labour Statistics and the American Heritage Time Use Survey. For more details on how these data are constructed see Ramey (2009), pp.3-4, and Appendix A.

  # Whale populations (Pershing et al. 2010)
  
  Estimates of whale populations pre-whaling and in 2001 were published by Pershing et al. (2010), and originally sourced from Christensen (2006). See full references below.
  
  The dates of pre-whaling differs depending on the whale species and oceanic region. This ranges from as far back as 1530 for Right whales. The most common 'pre-whaling' date in the original source was in the late 19th and early 20th century. Here we have coded all pre-whaling dates as 1890 for consistency, but it should be noted that this date varies by species. The latest date – 2001 – is consistent across species.
  
  All estimates are of the global total.

  # Wildfire data in the US (NIFC)
  
  The National Interagency Coordination Center at NIFC compiles annual wildland fire statistics for federal and state agencies. This information is provided through Situation Reports, which have been in use for several decades. 
  
  **Prior to 1983, sources of these figures are not known, or cannot be confirmed, and were not derived from the current situation reporting process. As a result the figures prior to 1983 should not be compared to later data.
  
  The average acres burned per wildfire has been calculated by Our World in Data by dividing the total number of acres burned by the number of wildfires in a given year. Note this simplifies and does not account for the distribution of wildfire extents.

  # Women's Economic Opportunity 2012 - Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)
  
  The Women's Economic Opportunity (WEO) Index measures five categories to determine whether the environment for both women employees and women entrepreneurs is favourable. Five category scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of underlying indicators and scaled 0-100, where 100=most favourable. These categories are: Labor policy and practice (comprising two sub-categories: Labor policy and labor practice); Access to Finance; Education and training; Women's legal and social status; and the General business environment. Each category or sub-category features either four or five underlying indicators.
  
  The overall score (from 0-100) is calculated from a simple average of the unweighted category and indicator variables. That is, every indicator contributes equally to their parent category and every category contributes equally to the overall score.
  
  EIU note: The criteria used in this study were chosen in close consultation between the Economist Intelligence Unit and panels of experts, mostly in 2009 and 2010. The indicator list was reviewed and revised at an experts meeting held at the offices of UN Women in July 2011.
  
  World Bank classifications include entities: High income (OECD), High income, High income (non-OECD), Upper-middle income, Lower-middle income, Low income, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. 
  
  UN classifications include entities: Europe, Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Africa.

  # Women’s Political Representation using Paxton et al (2006), IPU (2017) & WDI (2017) 
  
  Data construction:
  Paxton et al (2006) provides data on five milestones of women’s political representation from 1893 to 2003. Our dataset updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources).
  
  Paxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1945-2003. Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various sources. IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below. Moreover, this data extension to 2017 means our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003. Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year. We have therefore derived the number of sovereign countries generated in any given year, as well as the number which have attained each of the five milestones.
  
  To overcome methodological differences, the attainment of milestones was assessed in two ways. Firstly, the number and share of sovereign countries were assessed relative to ‘ordered’ milestones. This results from Paxton et al’s (2006) assumption that a country only has an elected woman MP after universal suffrage is granted. However, there were 17 countries - Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, South Africa, USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States – whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage. Secondly, we assessed the number and share of sovereign countries which independently satisfied five milestones.

  Sovereignty 
  CIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran. Likewise, we determine end of sovereignty for Libya and Serbia and Montenegro using the same source.

  Share of women in parliament 
  IPU’s Statistical Archive (http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm) for all countries from 2004 to 2017. For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament. This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995. They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments. Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year. If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.
  Handling data issues: 
  For years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament. For most countries, the values match exactly. However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match. As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003. Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps. For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.

According to the report the data comes from several sources. In the best cases data from the civil registration systems were used directly to calculate the estimates of maternal mortality rates. When these data were not available two-part multi-level regression model were used to estimate MMRs for all target years. The three selected predictor variables in the regression model are: GDP, the general fertility rate (GFR) and the proportion of skilled attendants at birth.

  The data on political regimes is taken from the Polity IV dataset and I have added the information on colonial regimes absed on Wimmer and Min.
  
  Wimmer and Min (2006) – “From empire to nation-state: Explaining war in the modern world, 1816-2001”, American Sociological Review 71(6):867-897, 2006.
  
   
  
  Three changes have been made to the Polity IV measures:
  
  *For the period 1937 to 1945 I interpolated for China with -5 (the score in the year before and after). This is the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45).
  
   
  
  * For the years 1861 and 1860 China has no data in Polity IV. Here the score -6 which is the score in the period before and after is assigned. 1861 is the year of the Battle of Shanghai during the Taiping Rebellion.
  
   
  
  * For India the Polity IV has no data for 1947, 1948, and 1949 – the time of the "Partition of India". For the period after the Polity IV score is 9; here this score is used from 1947 (the year of independence from Britain).
  
  The data on the countries’ population is taken from Gapminder and for the total world population from Our World In Data. The difference between the total of number of people for which information on the country regime was available and the total world population is reported as "Country in tranistion or no data".

  # Year of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) elimination (WHO and KIWANIS, 2018)
  
  The WHO described 57 countries as at risk of maternal and neonatal tetanus in 1999 here: http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/MNTE_initiative/en/index4.html

  # Year of last recorded wild poliomyelitis virus - WHO (GPEI) (2017)
  
  In three countries polio remains endemic today: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. 
  
  Switzerland's data point was missing in the original dataset and was obtained from the WHO (2017) time series dataset "Reported Cases of Selected Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)" which can be found under point "3.1 Reported incidence time series" here: http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en/ 
  
  Somalia was listed twice in the GPEI table, so again the WHO (2017) dataset cited above was consulted to make out which year was in fact the correct information. 
  
  Timor's datapoint originally read "pre 1985" and was replaced with 1985 for this visualization.

  # Year of smallpox eradication by country - WHO (1988)
  
  The only data not taken from the maps but from the text are the data for Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand: For Canada the authors reported that “endemic smallpox was eliminated by 1944”, for the USA only that it was eliminated “the latter half of the 1940s” (I chose 1948 for the visualization). Dates for the last outbreaks of smallpox in Australia (1917) and New Zealand (1914) are reported in the text – in both countries smallpox has always been rare. 
  
  The dates for Madagascar and Namibia are not exactly known – the authors only report that smallpox was eradicated in Madagascar before 1918 and for Namibia before 1955 (so I chose these years for eradication). 
  
  Countries are shown in their current borders – successor countries of Yugoslavia, the USSR and the Sudan are assigned the eradication date of these states: 1925 for Yugoslavia, 1936 for the USSR, and 1972 for the Sudan.

  # Youth Mortality Rate - UN IGME (2018)
  
  Youth Mortality Rate measures the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15. 
  
  This dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME).
  
  We define and calculate 'youth mortality' based on the combination of:
  - under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)
  -  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 15).
  
  Both of these metrics are available from the UN IGME. Based on these estimates we calculate 'youth mortality': the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15.
