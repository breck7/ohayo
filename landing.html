<h1>ohayo!</h1>
<p>ohayo is a research prototype for a new family of programming languages called <a href="https://github.com/breck7/jtree">Tree Languages</a>. Tree Languages are like Lisps without parentheses.</p>
<p>Why use Tree Languages over Lisps? Tree Languages use a very simple geometric syntax that we think will make programs easier to develop, analyze and maintain at scale.</p>
<h2>get notified</h2>
<p>Tree Languages and Ohayo are very new! If you are a busy professional and want to wait until they are more stable, send an email to <a href="emailmewhenready@ohayo.computer">emailmewhenready@ohayo.computer</a>. We will send you 1 email when it's ready, and then delete your email address.</p>
<h2>try now</h2>
<p>If you are feeling adventurous, you can try the <a href="http://ohayo.computer">ohayo preview release</a>.</p>
<h2>star us on github</h2>
<p>ohayo is a mostly open source project. In addition to the <a href="https://github.com/breck7/jtree">Tree Notation library</a>, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/breck7/ohayo">ohayo github repo.</a></p>
