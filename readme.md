# Ohayo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/treenotation/ohayo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/treenotation/ohayo)

Ohayo is a fast and free data science studio. Imagine if you could do data science at the speed of voice.

![Slides](slides.gif)

You can try ohayo at [https://ohayo.computer](https://ohayo.computer), [download Ohayo on GitHub](https://github.com/treenotation/ohayo), try Ohayo [hosted on GitHub](https://treenotation.github.io/ohayo/), or install it using `npm install ohayo`.

## Ohayo, Tree Notation and Maia

This project includes a data science web application AND a new dataflow programming language for data science that I currently call Maia. Maia is a Tree Language, built using [Tree Notation](https://treenotation.org/).

## BETA!

Ohayo is still beta, and we are still iterating quickly. We encourage you to post feedback here or on the [Ohayo subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ohayocomputer), but it may not be stable until 2020.

## Unbeatable Features

1. The simplest syntax possible. No parentheses, no brackets, no semicolons. Just words you can speak.
2. Write by hand or program visually. The first visual editor that generates perfectly clean code.
3. Autocomplete like you've never seen before. AI powered autocomplete that keeps getting better.
4. Free and open source. The price is $0, and extensions and collaboration are welcome.
5. No installing required. Run Ohayo instantly in your browser, even on your mobile device.
6. No tracking, no cookies. Ohayo doesn't track users, use cookies, or store your data.
7. Secure by design. Your data stays on your machines, we never see it.
8. Runs anywhere. Run it from our sites, host it yourself, or run it on your local machine.
