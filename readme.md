Ohayo
=====

Ohayo is a tool for building programs in Tree Languages. This is a preview release. A reliable release will ship in late 2017. We **don't recommend Ohayo yet**, unless you are a computer scientist or programming language researcher interested in exploring Tree Languages more.

Tree Languages
==============

Ohayo is the first editor for a newly discovered family of programming languages called Tree Languages. These languages use a new universal syntax called <a href="https://github.com/breck7/jtree">Tree Notation</a>.

Tree Languages don't have parentheses, quotes, semicolons, brackets, et cetera. Tree Languages just use geometry (whitespace) to give your programs structure. The technical explanation is that Tree Languages extend Tree Notation, a newly discovered universal syntax, and that they use Tree Grammars and not BNF Grammars.

Tree Languages are magical. Although much simpler than traditional languages, they can do everything that existing languages can do but with fewer parts and in a cleaner and more organized way. Programs written in Tree Languages can be easily visualized and analyzed. They can also be easily coauthored with neural nets, so you can write better programs faster.

You can try ohayo at http://ohayo.computer or download <a href="https://github.com/breck7/ohayo">Ohayo on GitHub.</a>

Warning - There are frequent breaking changes and bugs!
=======================================================

This is a preview release and we are constantly learning new best practices with Tree Languages. Breaking changes occur weekly.

There are also bugs.

By using Ohayo, and providing feedback to us, you can help us make Ohayo better.
