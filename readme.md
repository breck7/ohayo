Ohayo
=====

Ohayo is a tool to help you build perfect programs, faster.

Ohayo is the first editor for a newly discovered family of programming languages called  <a href="2017-06-21-show-hn-programming-is-now-two-dimensional.html">ETNs</a>.

You can use ohayo at http://ohayo.computer or download <a href="https://github.com/breck7/ohayo">Ohayo on GitHub.</a>


Warning - There will be Bugs and Breaks!
========================================

This is still "Day 1" of Ohayo, and Tree Notation and ETNs in general, so there will be bugs!

Over the next few weeks, there will also be frequent breaking changes.

By using Ohayo, and providing feedback to us, you can help us make Ohayo better.

This version is for researchers and dreamers. Busy professionals should wait a few weeks.

What You Can Currently Make with Ohayo
======================================

You can currently use Ohayo to build programs in two languages: Flow and Fire.

Flow is a dataflow language for doing data science. With Flow, you add blocks which can load, transform
and visualize data.

Fire is an ETN that compiles to Javascript. You can use Fire to build programs visually. Programs
built in Fire will compile to beautiful, clean, Javascript code. By writing your code in Fire
instead of Javascript, you get the same code but can also visualize it as you go.

How to Give Feedback
====================

Email is the best way to send us feedback.

Please use this template:

to: feedback@ohayo.computer
Subject: I rate Ohayo a [0 - 10]
Body: [why you gave it that rating and anything else you want to say]

In your subject, please rate Ohayo on a scale of 0 - 10. 10 means you love Ohayo and are highly likely to recommend it to your friends. 0 means you HATE Ohayo but are giving feedback out of pity.

Thank you for your feedback!
