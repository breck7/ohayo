Ohayo
=====

Ohayo is a tool to help you build perfect programs, faster.

Ohayo is the first editor for a newly discovered family of programming languages called  <a href="2017-06-21-show-hn-programming-is-now-two-dimensional.html">ETNs</a>.

You can use ohayo at http://ohayo.computer or download <a href="https://github.com/breck7/ohayo">Ohayo on GitHub.</a>


Warning - There will be Bugs and Breaks!
========================================

This is still "Day 1" of Ohayo, and Tree Notation and ETNs in general, so there will be bugs!

Over the next few weeks, there will also be frequent breaking changes.

By using Ohayo, and providing feedback to us, you can help us make Ohayo better.

This version is for researchers and dreamers. Busy professionals should wait a few weeks.

What You Can Currently Make with Ohayo
======================================

You can currently use Ohayo to build programs in two languages: Flow and Fire.

Flow is a dataflow language for doing data science. With Flow, you add blocks which can load, transform
and visualize data.

Fire is an ETN that compiles to Javascript. You can use Fire to build programs visually. Programs
built in Fire will compile to beautiful, clean, Javascript code. By writing your code in Fire
instead of Javascript, you get the same code but can also visualize it as you go.

How to Give Feedback
====================

Email is the best way to send us feedback.

Please use this template:

Subject: include just a number between 0 and 10 which states how likely you are to recommend
Ohayo to a friend. 10 means you love Ohayo and are highly likely to recommend it. 0 means you HATE Ohayo
but are giving feedback out of pity.

Body: say why you gave that score and whatever else you want to say.

feedback@ohayo.computer

Thank you for your feedback!

Please Buy an Ohayo Token
=========================

Do you use Ohayo, but have no money? No problem. Use Ohayo as much as you want for free.

If you use Ohayo and have a little money to spare, please consider buying a token.

Buying an Ohayo token helps make Ohayo better by supporting the people and projects that do the
research, design and engineering that makes the Ohayo software work.

A token lasts one year and costs $10.

Token purchases are final and have no cash value. Ohayo works the same whether you have a token or not.

However, when you buy a token, you'll get a thank you email which will include your token #.
In addition, whenever someone buys a token whose number is evenly divisible by 100, they will also
receive an email with a custom original joke. Funniness not guaranteed.

To buy a token, PayPal $10 to tokens@ohayo.computer

Do you love Ohayo? Consider giving a token to all your friends, employees, coworkers, neighbors, relatives (living or deceased) and pets. Just PayPal $10 * the number of tokens you want to tokens@ohayo.computer

Thank you for your support!
