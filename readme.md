Ohayo
=====

Ohayo is a tool to help you build perfect programs, faster.

Ohayo is the first editor for a newly discovered family of programming languages called  <a href="2017-06-21-show-hn-programming-is-now-two-dimensional.html">ETNs</a>.

You can use ohayo at http://ohayo.computer or download <a href="https://github.com/breck7/ohayo">Ohayo on GitHub.</a>


Warning - There are frequent breaking changes and bugs!
=======================================================

This is still "Day 1" of Ohayo as well as Tree Notation and ETNs, so we are constantly learning new best practices. Breaking changes occur weekly.

There are also bugs!

By using Ohayo, and providing feedback to us, you can help us make Ohayo better.

This version is for researchers and curious programmers with time to experiment. Busy professionals should wait a few months.

What You Can Currently Make with Ohayo
======================================

You can currently use Ohayo to build programs in three languages: Flow, Fire and Turtle.

Flow is a dataflow language for doing data science. With Flow, you add blocks which can load, transform
and visualize data.

Fire is an experimental ETN that compiles to Javascript.

Turtle is an ETN that compiles to Logo.

How to Give Feedback
====================

Email is the best way to send us feedback.
