#### What is ohayo?

ohayo is the world's first ETN editor.

#### What is an ETN editor?

An ETN editor is a code editor for a newly discovered family of 2-dimensional programming
languages called ETNs. You can read more in the paper here: https://github.com/breck7/treenotation/blob/master/paper/treenotation.pdf.

#### What are ETNs good for?

The paper predicts ETNs will let you design, develop and debug software more than 10x faster than you can
with even the best 1-dimensional languages like Javascript, C, Java, Python, Lisp, R, Arc, Go, Rust, etc.

#### What can I do with ETN editors that I can't do with normal code editors?

ETNs define one right way to write code. Humans and machines write code in the same style.
Because of this, ETNs let machines augment the programmer in ways never before possible. ETN editors let you do powerful things that 1D-editors cannot, like alternate between programming visually and textually. This document
is a program written in an ETN called Flow. You can edit the source by hand or visually with ohayo.

#### Who is ohayo for?

ohayo is built for all programmers. Right now, it's for researchers and dreamers, but soon will be
good enough for busy profressionals.

#### What can I build with ohayo?

That is largely up to you! Please let us know what languages and types of things you want to build with ohayo,
and we will do our best to prioritize the most popular requests.

#### What ETNs does ohayo currently support?

Right now, ohayo ships with 2 ETNs. "Flow", an ETN for data science and data visualization,
and "Fire", an ETN that compiles to Javascript.

#### Does ohayo work in all browsers?

Currently we have some known issues in Edge, Firefox, and Safari. We are working on those.

#### Where are my boards saved?

In this early release, just to local storage. More persistence options coming soon.

#### Is ohayo open source?

Just about. You can get the TN source here: https://github.com/breck7/treenotation/ and the minified
version of Ohayo here https://github.com/breck7/ohayo . With the latter you can run and modify Ohayo
locally or on your own servers. The full source is coming soon. Just need to get some sleep and
give it a few more edits.

#### How can I support Ohayo?

Thanks for asking! By providing feedback, buying a token, or even contributing code. Details in the
readme on GitHub.
