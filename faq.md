#### What is ohayo?

ohayo is the world's first Tree Language editor.

#### How are Tree Languages different?

Tree Languages don't have parentheses, quotes, semicolons, brackets, et cetera. Tree Languages just use geometry (whitespace) to give your programs structure. The technical explanation is that Tree Languages extend Tree Notation, a newly discovered universal syntax, and that they use Tree Grammars and not BNF Grammars.

#### Why would I want to use Tree Languages?

It has been predicted, once tooling for Tree Languages matures, that in the years ahead Tree Languages will let you design, develop and debug software more than 10x faster than you can with even the best 1-dimensional languages like Javascript, C, Java, Python, Lisp, R, Arc, Go, Rust, etc.

#### When will I be able to rely on ohayo to build things?

Late 2017.

#### Does ohayo work in all browsers?

Currently we test primarily in Chrome. Full cross browser testing coming soon.

#### Where are my boards saved?

In this early release, just to local storage. More persistence options coming soon.

#### Is ohayo open source?

Just about. You can get the Tree Notation source here: https://github.com/breck7/treenotation/ and the minified
version of Ohayo here https://github.com/breck7/ohayo . With the latter you can run and modify Ohayo
locally or on your own servers. The full source is coming soon, pending a few more refactors.
