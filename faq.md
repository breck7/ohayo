#### What is ohayo?

ohayo is the world's first ETN editor.

#### What is an ETN editor?

An ETN editor is a code editor for a newly discovered family of 2-dimensional programming
languages called ETNs. You can read more in the paper here: https://github.com/breck7/treenotation/blob/master/paper/treenotation.pdf.

#### What are ETNs good for?

The paper predicts ETNs will let you design, develop and debug software more than 10x faster than you can
with even the best 1-dimensional languages like Javascript, C, Java, Python, Lisp, R, Arc, Go, Rust, etc.

#### What can I do with ETN editors that I can't do with normal code editors?

ETNs do not use BNF grammars. ETNs only use geometry to give a program structure. This makes things much simpler.

It is much easier to write development tools for ETNs than for BNF languages. It is easy for machines to write great ETN code.

Things that are nearly impossible with BNF languages become easy with ETNs, such as visual programming. This document, for example,
is a program written in an ETN called Flow. You can edit the source by hand or visually with ohayo.

#### Who is ohayo for?

ohayo is built for all programmers. Right now, it's for researchers but soon will be
good enough for busy professionals.

#### What can I build with ohayo?

That is largely up to you! Please let us know what languages and types of things you want to build with ohayo,
and we will do our best to prioritize the most popular requests.

#### What ETNs does ohayo currently support?

Right now, ohayo ships with 3 ETNs. "Flow", an ETN for data science and data visualization, "Fire", is an ETN that compiles to Javascript, and "Turtle" is an ETN that compiles to Logo.

#### Does ohayo work in all browsers?

Currently we have some known issues in Edge, Firefox, and Safari. We are working on those.

#### Where are my boards saved?

In this early release, just to local storage. More persistence options coming soon.

#### Is ohayo open source?

Just about. You can get the TN source here: https://github.com/breck7/treenotation/ and the minified
version of Ohayo here https://github.com/breck7/ohayo . With the latter you can run and modify Ohayo
locally or on your own servers. The full source is coming soon, pending a few more refactors.

#### How can I support Ohayo?

Thanks for asking! By providing feedback or even contributing code. Details in the
readme on GitHub.
